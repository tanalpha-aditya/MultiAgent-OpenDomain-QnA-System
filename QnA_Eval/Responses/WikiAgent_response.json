It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. Its historical timeframe precedes that of Assassin's Creed III (2012), but its modern-day sequences succeed III's own. Black Flag was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in October 2013 and a month later for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was later ported to the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Assassin's Creed Rogue in December 2019. The game was released for Google Stadia in September 2021.\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who is manipulated into uncovering secrets related to the Assassin-Templar conflict and the precursor race known as the First Civilization. The main story is set in the West Indies during the Golden Age of Piracy from 1715 to 1722, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather of Assassin's Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor and father of antagonist Haytham Kenway, as he searches for fortune and a mythical location called the Observatory, which is s",

The declaration is a performative speech act (or the public signing of a document) by an authorized party of a national government, in order to create a state of war between two or more states.\nThe legality of who is competent to declare war varies between nations and forms of government. In many nations, that power is given to the head of state or sovereign. In other cases, something short of a full declaration of war, such as a letter of marque or a covert operation, may authorise war-like acts by privateers or mercenaries. The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in the Hague Convention (III) of 1907 on the Opening of Hostilities.\nSince 1945, developments in international law such as the United Nations Charter, which prohibits both the threat and the use of force in international conflicts, have made declarations of war largely obsolete in international relations, though such declarations may have relevance within the domestic law of the belligerents or of neutral nations. The UN Security Council, under powers granted in articles 24 and 25, and Chapter VII of the Charter, may authorize collective action to maintain or enforce international peace and security.

The song's chorus repeats the phrase \"I can only imagine\" to convey the idea that the joys of heaven are beyond human comprehension.\n\nSo, to answer your question, \"I Can Only Imagine\" is not a song about a specific event or date, but rather a song about the hope and promise of eternal life and reunion with loved ones in heaven.",

        "response": "In Germany, Adolf Hitler is widely regarded as a criminal and a symbol of the atrocities committed during World War II and the Holocaust. The vast majority of Germans today reject Hitler's ideology and policies, and most people view him as a figure of shame and guilt.\n\nIn fact, Germany has a strong culture of remembrance and education about the Holocaust and the Nazi regime, with many museums, memorials, and educational programs dedicated to preserving the memory of the victims and promoting tolerance and understanding.\n\nAccording to a 2020 survey by the German Marshall Fund, 95% of Germans consider Hitler to be a \"bad\" or \"very bad\" person, and 92% believe that the Nazi regime was responsible for the Holocaust. The same survey found that 85% of Germans believe that Germany should continue to take responsibility for its past and 77% believe that the country should continue to educate its citizens about the Holocaust.\n\nIn addition, many Germans see Hitler as a reminder of the dangers of extremism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism, and as a warning against the rise of similar ideologies in the future.\n\nOverall, while there may be some individuals who still hold sympathetic views towards Hitler or the Nazi regime, they are a small minority and are widely rejected by the majority of Germans.",

            "American lady married to a German man and we currently live in Germany. Germans have it beat into them from a very early age that the Holocaust was horrible. That there is no excuse for what Hitler did. That you do not put country above being a human being. If am correct it took up the majority of their history lessons (this does not mean that they at unaware of the world). Secondly, TV here is forever running documentaries on the holocaust and WWII. I am pretty sure I have seen footage at least once a day. Third, I have never been in a place where people are so quick to defend a person being verbally or physically attacked by another person. On the train I have seen many altercations (verbal) that generally ends with the asshole being called out by at least two other people (sometimes the entire train car gets pissed). So they aren't generally ones to stand by and let that shit happen. That being said it has caused some issues. In Germany it is illegal to argue facts of the Holocaust in public. The official story has not changed in a long time even with new data and facts present. Historians can lose their jobs or be arrested for trying to argue on the side of truth. So, there is that. It has also made racism a very difficult thing to talk about. No one wants to talk about the fact that German citizens with Turkish parents are still treated like subcitizens ....but they are. Lastly, this does not mean that Germans don't have a sense of humor about Hitler. I would, however, suggest that if you crack a Hitler or Holocaust related joke that you know the person you are talking to very well and refrain from doing so in public. People are very vigilant when it comes to anything Nazi related. Graffiti is covered quickly after the police are contacted. Edit: to be clear Germans dislike Hitler. There is no type of worship on the part of the German people..some even still feel guilty. Some don't like joking about him. Overall the German people feel a duty to not sit by and allow a new Hitler to do what Hitler did. So, they study history and they talk about it.",

As mentioned before, my friend said there are many laws restricting Nazi propaganda and racism in particular. Last main thing he pointed out is \"If you go anywhere in Germany asking where Dachau is [one of the concentration camps and now a historical museum for those who don't know], many will pretend they have never heard of it,\" and he continued by saying it's because there are people in denial, not because they are dicks and refuse to believe any of it happened, but because they feel guilty of the country's past and wish it never happened.

        "response": "A sensitive topic!\n\nTo provide a balanced answer, I'll break down the concerns and address them objectively.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n1. **Funding redistribution**: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as ObamaCare, does redistribute funds from those who have health insurance to those who don't. This is done to ensure that everyone has access to healthcare, regardless of their income or pre-existing conditions.\n2. **Welfare and food stamps**: The ACA does not directly fund welfare programs or food stamps. However, some individuals who receive Medicaid expansion benefits under the ACA may also be eligible for other government assistance programs, such as food stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP).\n\n**Fairness:**\n\nWhile it's understandable that your parent might feel frustrated about the perceived redistribution of funds, their view is not entirely fair. Here's why:\n\n1. **Universal healthcare**: The ACA aims to provide universal healthcare coverage, which is a fundamental human right. By redistributing funds, the program ensures that everyone has access to healthcare, regardless of their income or employment status.\n2. **Economic benefits**: Studies have shown that expanding healthcare coverage can have positive economic effects, such as reducing healthcare costs, increasing productivity, and improving overall well-being.\n3. **Targeted assistance**: The ACA's Medicaid expansion is designed to target low-income individuals and families who need healthcare coverage the most. This targeted approach helps to ensure that those who are most vulnerable receive the support they need.\n4. **Private insurance subsidies**: The ACA also provides subsidies to individuals and families who purchase private health insurance through the health insurance marketplaces. These subsidies help make healthcare more affordable for those who are not eligible for Medicaid expansion.\n\n**Missing the point:**\n\nWhile your parent's concerns are understandable, they might be missing the broader context and benefits of the ACA. The program is designed to:\n\n1. **Improve healthcare access**: Ensure that everyone has access to healthcare, regardless of their income or employment status.\n2. **Reduce healthcare costs**: Encourage cost-effective healthcare practices, reduce administrative costs, and promote preventive care.\n3. **Strengthen the economy**: Boost economic growth, create jobs, and reduce healthcare-related costs for businesses and individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, while your parent's concerns are valid, their view is not entirely fair. The ACA is a complex program designed to provide universal healthcare coverage, improve healthcare access, and strengthen the economy. By understanding the program's goals and benefits, it's possible to have a more nuanced discussion about the issues surrounding healthcare reform.",

I've never had a house fire but my tax money is still used to fund fire departments. Healthcare funding is no different. It's also a bit of a fallacy to assume everyone who is unemployed is a deadbeat slacker. Some people are simply unable to find sustainable work, despite trying their hardest whether it be due to a disability or simply bad luck.

That said, this is: * a) Already true. Homeless, pennyless folks can walk into an emergency room and receive care for their major injuries/illnesses, and your parents are gonna pay for that. * b) Cheaper. Homeless, pennyless deadbeats can get PREVENTATIVE care for free under Obamacare, and that care is way cheaper than fixing the problem later when it's about to kill them and they come into the emergency room. * c) Gonna help your parents. Maybe, god forbid, your Dad gets cancer. The stress makes him do worse at work and he's fired. He is uninsurable. Nobody would cover him, since he has cancer, a pre-existing condition if there ever was one. Under Obamacare, he can (and in fact is required to) still be insured. Without Obamacare, he'll be required to make a decision between using all of his savings and mortgaging his house to try to save his own life vs. just dying and leaving money for his family.",

Welfare, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, etc. The biggest of these were set up in the 30's during the Great Depression. It was Roosevelt's New Deal. So, it's not like President Obama created those. Obamacare was called by many as the completion of the New Deal. It fills in the last missing piece, (nearly) universal health care. I think the simplest justification comes down to this. Are we a nation that lets its poorest citizens die because they can't afford health care? If not, then we all need to chip in to help.",
            "This is already true. Your parents live in a fantasy world where they don't already pay for other people's healthcare. If \"foodstamp collectin' dead beats\" can't afford a visit to a doctor they can just walk into an ER and skip out on the bill instead. They'll potentially have bill collectors after them but if they are genuinely poor little will be gained by that. People who can and do pay their medical bills pay more to make up for those people. The key point to note is that ER care is the most expensive possible way someone like that could receive treatment. A doctor's visit may only be around $200 to treat a common ailment, but given the person was unable or unwilling to pay they just cost us all a $2,000 ER visit. **tl;dr** Your parents can either pay the \"dead beats'\" $2,000 ER bill (no ObamaCare) or pay the \"dead beats'\" $200 doctor bill (ObamaCare). The third option where they don't pay either is a figment of their imagination.",

If we don't, then we're letting honest unemployed people - people who are genuinely trying to find a job - we're saying they don't deserve health care if they get sick. We're saying that they're so worthless that if they get sick, they should literally *die*. Is that really what we've come to as a society, to say that if you're between jobs, then you're a worthless human being who deserves to die of an untreated sickness? I find that view repugnant.",

Very little money is being reallocated from your parents taxes to the poor as a result of Obamacare. Obamacare is paid for in two major ways, and a lot of minor ways. The major ways are cuts to Medicare, and taxes on the rich. The minor ways are increasing the burden on states via Medicaid (Supreme Court undid some of this, saying it can't be forced on states), increasing taxes in a few areas like tanning beds, and making some people pay more in taxes by decreasing flexible spending caps. If your parents were very rich, they have a point. If they are Medicare recipients, they sort of have a point, but their point would be saying \"Some of our future planned entitlement money is being used as an entitlement for another group.\" Overall, for the average American, Obamacare doesn't shift much money around from what they pay or to where it goes.",
            "An economist would say healthcare has a [positive externality]( URL_0 ). You can look at it like this: * The amount a person buys of a good (eg doctor visits) is based on how many they want and how much they can afford. This is referred to as the **private benefit**. * There are some things you can buy that make everyone better off. For example: going to the doctor every time you are sick will make you less likely to make other people sick. This is referred to as a **public benefit**. * Because only the private benefit is taken into account when someone is buying something, people buy less of a good than is **socially optimal** (private benefit + public benefit) * Governments give money to people so that they will buy more of these goods in order to make everyone else feel better (ie get closer to the socially optimal amount of consumption).

            "[In his own words]( URL_0 ):  >  A number of detractors have suggested that if Snowden, who disclosed controversial top-secret N.S.A. programs to reporters, truly wanted to commit an act of civil disobedience for reasons of conscience, then he should have faced the legal consequences, making his case to the American public while standing trial at home.  >  When I asked why he didn’t take this route, Snowden said that because of the way national-security laws have been interpreted since September 11, 2001, he believed that the government had deprived him, and other whistle-blowers, of ever having the opportunity to make their cases in this time-honored tradition. Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, “It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.”)  >  Snowden said that he would “love” to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, “I have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they’re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I’m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so. But they’ve declined.”  >  Instead, Snowden said, “They want to use special procedures. They want a closed court. They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.” So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn't believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a \"show\" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently.",

Even *if* we make the incredibly generous assumption that there's no corruption in the American government, and that there's no incentive to protect the NSA, Snowden still committed a crime. Someone else doing something illegal doesn't usually give you the right to also do something illegal. So it's entirely possible that while the NSA will be penalized for their actions, so will Snowden. And that's really the best case scenario, seeing as there *is* likely incentive for the government to protect the NSA. Or worse, there might be actual *justification* for the NSA's actions, which will seriously hurt any of Snowden's defenses.

He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love; and is widely revered among Hindu divinities. Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.\nThe anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Līlā. He is a central figure in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being. His iconography reflects these legends and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.\nThe name and synonyms of Krishna have been traced to 1st millennium BCE literature and cults. In some sub-traditions, like Krishnaism, Krishna is worshipped as the Supreme God and Svayam Bhagavan (God Himself). These sub-traditions arose in the context of the medieval era Bhakti movement.

        "response": "What a complex and multifaceted question! There are many factors that contribute to the prevalence of depression among adults. Here are some possible reasons:\n\n1. **Changing societal values and expectations**: The rapid pace of technological advancements, globalization, and shifting societal norms can lead to feelings of disconnection, anxiety, and depression.\n2. **Increased stress and pressure**: The modern workplace, with its emphasis on productivity, competition, and long working hours, can be a significant source of stress, which can contribute to depression.\n3. **Lack of social connections and community**: The decline of traditional social structures, such as community organizations and neighborhood networks, can leave people feeling isolated and disconnected.\n4. **Mental health stigma**: The stigma surrounding mental health issues can prevent people from seeking help, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n5. **Genetic predisposition**: Depression can run in families, and genetic factors can play a role in an individual's susceptibility to depression.\n6. **Trauma and adverse childhood experiences**: Childhood trauma, abuse, or neglect can increase the risk of depression later in life.\n7. **Lack of purpose and meaning**: Feeling unfulfilled or without a sense of purpose can contribute to depression.\n8. **Sleep deprivation and lifestyle factors**: Poor sleep habits, lack of exercise, and unhealthy diet can all contribute to depression.\n9. **Mental health comorbidities**: Co-occurring mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, substance abuse, or personality disorders, can increase the risk of depression.\n10. **Demographic changes**: The increasing prevalence of depression among adults may be linked to demographic changes, such as the aging population, urbanization, and changes in family structures.\n11. **Lack of access to mental health resources**: Limited access to mental health services, including therapy and medication, can exacerbate depression.\n12. **Cultural and societal expectations around emotions**: The pressure to conform to societal norms around emotions, such as suppressing emotions or hiding vulnerability, can contribute to depression.\n13. **Technology and social media**: The constant stream of information and social media can lead to feelings of FOMO (fear of missing out), anxiety, and depression.\n14. **Economic uncertainty and financial stress**: Economic instability, job insecurity, and financial stress can contribute to depression.\n15. **Lack of self-care and self-compassion**: Neglecting one's own emotional and physical well-being, as well as a lack of self-compassion, can increase the risk of depression.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that depression is a complex condition that can be influenced by a combination of these factors.

            "Well Billy, it's like this... When you're young, being an adult seems like a really great thing. You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there's all that naughty stuff you're not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what \"they want to be when they grow up\". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don't really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You've got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you've got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You've also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you've got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don't pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you're not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you've never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you're going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it's going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can't afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there's all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won't, but... there's a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you're not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you've ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won't ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don't have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it's not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn't make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don't have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It's a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren't so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve. That's part of why people are depressed, Billy. And that's all without mentioning the wars and the suffering and the poverty in countries other than our own, places we would like to help because they're people just like us... but we're too busy struggling to get by ourselves, to really help them as much as we'd like. Grown up life is hard, Billy. I'm sorry.",

About the only thing you can tell a 5 year old is that a person suffering from depression has a brain that is telling them to be depressed. Sometimes medications help to make it harder for the brain to tell them to be depressed. That said, there are basically two types of depression, there is situational depression (and this usually has a large component of sadness with it) and there is chronic depression which is not really a \"sadness\" as much as a feeling of apathy and a lack of motivation.

Depending on the balance of the good and the bad, you'll say you had a good, or a bad day. Now imagine that I selectively dull your capacity to feel the good parts of the day. Most days will, on balance, be bad. That's depression, in a nutshell.

        "response": "Overtime is a common practice in many industries where employees work beyond their regular scheduled hours. Here's how it typically works:\n\n**What is Overtime?**\n\nOvertime is when an employee works more hours than their regular scheduled hours, usually beyond 40 hours per week. In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay non-exempt employees (those eligible for overtime) at least 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek.\n\n**How is Overtime Paid?**\n\nThere are two main ways overtime is paid:\n\n1. **Time-and-a-half**: Non-exempt employees are paid 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. For example, if an employee earns $20 per hour, they would earn $30 per hour for overtime hours.\n2. **Double time**: Some employers may pay double the employee's regular hourly rate for hours worked beyond a certain threshold, usually 8 hours in a day or 80 hours in a two-week period.\n\n**Why is Overtime Profitable for a Company?**\n\nDespite the additional cost, overtime can be profitable for a company in several ways:\n\n1. **Increased productivity**: Overtime can help companies meet peak demand, complete projects, or respond to emergencies. This can lead to increased productivity and revenue.\n2. **Reduced recruitment and training costs**: Overtime can be a more cost-effective solution than hiring and training new employees to fill gaps in staffing.\n3. **Improved employee morale**: Offering overtime can be a way to show appreciation for employees' hard work and dedication, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and reduced turnover.\n4. **Competitive advantage**: In industries with high demand, offering overtime can be a competitive advantage, as it allows companies to attract and retain top talent.\n5. **Increased revenue**: Overtime can generate additional revenue for companies, especially in industries with high margins or where overtime work is particularly profitable.\n\n**Why is Overtime Offered?**\n\nOvertime is offered for several reasons:\n\n1. **Business needs**: Companies may need to work overtime to meet customer demand, complete projects, or respond to emergencies.\n2. **Employee needs**: Some employees may need overtime to make ends meet, pay off debt, or achieve financial goals.\n3. **Employee retention**: Offering overtime can be a way to retain employees who might otherwise leave for better opportunities.\n4. **Industry norms**: In some industries, overtime is a standard practice, and companies may offer it to remain competitive.\n\nIn summary, overtime can be a profitable strategy for companies when managed effectively, as it can increase productivity, reduce recruitment and training costs, and improve employee morale.",

        "response": "The reason \"selfie cameras\" (front-facing cameras) often flip a picture, while rear cameras don't, is due to the way our brains process visual information.\n\nWhen we take a selfie, we're looking directly at the camera, which means we're seeing ourselves from the perspective of the camera. To make the image more natural and intuitive, the camera software flips the image horizontally, so that our left side appears on the left side of the screen, just like we see ourselves in a mirror. This is called a \"mirror flip\" or \"horizontal flip\".\n\nOn the other hand, when we take a photo with the rear camera, we're not looking directly at the camera. We're looking at the scene in front of us, and the camera is capturing the image from a different perspective. Since we're not looking at the camera, there's no need to flip the image, and the camera software doesn't do so by default.\n\nHowever, some rear cameras may offer a feature to flip the image, usually called \"flip\" or \"mirror\" mode, which can be useful in certain situations, such as:\n\n1. Taking a photo of yourself with the rear camera, like when you're in a group and want to include yourself in the shot.\n2. Using the rear camera as a mirror, like when you need to check your appearance quickly.\n\nSo, to summarize: the selfie camera flips the image because we're looking directly at it, while the rear camera doesn't flip the image because we're not looking directly at it.",

An important rival to this approach are coherence-based accounts, which define rationality as internal coherence among the agent's mental states. Many rules of coherence have been suggested in this regard, for example, that one should not hold contradictory beliefs or that one should intend to do something if one believes that one should do it. Goal-based accounts characterize rationality in relation to goals, such as acquiring truth in the case of theoretical rationality. Internalists believe that rationality depends only on the person's mind. Externalists contend that ex",

This law amended Section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961, which previously allowed parents to use \"reasonable force\" to discipline their children.\n\nPrior to the amendment, Section 59 stated that a parent or guardian was not guilty of an offense if they used \"reasonable force\" for the purpose of correction or discipline. However, this provision was widely criticized for allowing physical punishment of children, and there were concerns that it was not in line with New Zealand's international human rights obligations.\n\nThe 2007 amendment removed the \"reasonable force\" defense and made it an offense for a parent or caregiver to use force against a child in a way that is likely to cause injury. The law also introduced a new defense for parents who use force in a way that is reasonable and necessary to protect the child from harm.\n\nThe anti-smacking law was the result of a long campaign by child advocacy groups and human rights organizations, who argued that physical punishment of children was harmful and ineffective. The law has been widely praised for promoting a culture of non-violence and respect for children's rights in New Zealand.",

Implantation is the first stage of gestation, and, when successful, the female is considered to be pregnant. An implanted embryo is detected by the presence of increased levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a pregnancy test. The implanted embryo will receive oxygen and nutrients in order to grow.\nFor implantation to take place the uterus must become receptive. Uterine receptivity involves much cross-talk between the embryo and the uterus, initiating changes to the endometrium. This stage gives a synchrony that opens a window of implantation that  enables successful implantation of a viable embryo. The endocannabinoid system plays a vital role in this synchrony in the uterus, influencing uterine receptivity, and embryo implantation. The embryo expresses cannabinoid receptors early in its development that are responsive to anandamide  (AEA) secreted in the uterus. AEA is produced at higher levels before implantation and is then down-regulated at the time of implantation. This signaling is of importance in the embryo-uterus crosstalk in regulating the timing of embryonic implantation and uterine receptivity.

        "response": "While vaccination provides excellent protection against many diseases, it's not a 100% guarantee that a vaccinated child won't contract the illness. Here's why:\n\n1. **Vaccines are not 100% effective**: While vaccines are highly effective, they're not foolproof. The effectiveness of a vaccine depends on various factors, such as the type of vaccine, the individual's immune system, and the presence of other health conditions. Even with a vaccinated child, there's a small chance they might still contract the disease.\n2. **Vaccines don't provide lifelong immunity**: Most vaccines provide immunity for a certain period, usually several years or even a lifetime. However, immunity can wane over time, making it possible for a vaccinated child to contract the disease if they're exposed to it.\n3. **Vaccines don't protect against all strains**: Some vaccines may not protect against all strains of a particular disease. For example, the flu vaccine may not protect against all flu strains, so a vaccinated child could still contract a different strain.\n4. **Vaccinated children can still carry and transmit the disease**: Even if a vaccinated child doesn't develop symptoms, they can still carry and transmit the disease to others, including their unvaccinated peers.\n5. **Unvaccinated children can spread diseases to others**: Unvaccinated children are more likely to contract and spread diseases, as they may not have developed immunity to the disease. This is particularly concerning in areas with low vaccination rates, where outbreaks are more likely to occur.\n6. **Vaccinated children can still experience severe reactions**: While rare, vaccinated children can still experience severe reactions to the disease, even if they've been vaccinated. This is why it's essential to take precautions to prevent exposure in the first place.\n\nGiven these factors, it's understandable that parents of vaccinated children might be concerned about the risk of their child contracting a disease from an unvaccinated child. This concern is often driven by a desire to protect their child's health and well-being, as well as the health of others in their community.\n\nIt's important to note that vaccination is still the most effective way to prevent the spread of diseases. By getting vaccinated, individuals not only protect themselves but also help create herd immunity, which benefits the entire community.",

Or say you're an old person whose immune system has simply weakened overall. In any of these cases, the unvaccinated child is a danger.",
            "There is also the chance of enough un-vaccinated people acting as a \"breeding chamber\" for the illness, allowing it to mutate and infect vaccinated people. Considering the long duration before a new vaccine can be made and given out, this is a pretty damnable risk.",

            "Vaccinations are not 100% effective, so someone who is vaccinated still may get the disease. As well, babies and other people who cannot be vaccinated are at risk of being infected by an unvaccinated child (or by a child who was vaccinated but who is still a carrier and who was infected by an unvaccinated child or adult.)",
            "*There are some people who are allergic to ingredients in vaccines and can't get some of them. *There are also people who are immuno-compromised in some way (perhaps from chemotherapy or from HIV), and they can't get vaccines. *Some infants aren't old enough for some vaccines. *There are some vaccines that can take multiple doses to be effective. For example, the whooping cough vaccine (DTAP), only protects about 60% of infants after the first dose. It isn't until after the 3rd or 4th dose (at about 12 months old) that almost all vaccinated babies are fully immune to whooping cough. In all of the above examples, those people rely on the immunity of those around them. When the vaccination rate in a community drops, it allows preventable diseases to spread if introduced. That's why people who can get vaccinated but don't put their entire community at risk.",
            "No, because vaccinations aren't 100% effective. So even if you vaccinate your child, there's like a 2% chance that, if exposed to a pathogen, they can still become infected. The best defense against this is everyone vaccinating their child. This is not to mention those children that have compromised immune systems and cannot receive vaccines."

        "input": "how is hd tv easily sent over the air with no loading/buffering but streaming hd video online takes a good internet connection and high bandwidth?",
        "response": "There are several reasons why HD TV can be easily sent over the air with no loading or buffering, but streaming HD video online requires a good internet connection and high bandwidth:\n\n1. **Broadcasting vs. Streaming**: Over-the-air broadcasting uses a one-to-many approach, where a single broadcast signal is transmitted to a large number of receivers. This allows for a fixed, predictable amount of data to be transmitted, which can be easily handled by the broadcast infrastructure. In contrast, online streaming uses a many-to-one approach, where multiple users request content from a single server, which can lead to variable and unpredictable data demands.\n2. **Fixed vs. Variable Bitrate**: Broadcast TV signals typically use a fixed bitrate, which means the amount of data transmitted per second is constant. This allows for efficient transmission and reception of the signal. In contrast, online streaming often uses variable bitrate (VBR) encoding, which adjusts the bitrate based on the complexity of the video content. This can lead to variable data transmission rates, which can cause buffering or loading issues.\n3. **Error Correction and Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: Broadcast TV signals use error correction and FEC to ensure that the signal is received correctly, even in the presence of noise or interference. Online streaming often relies on client-side error correction, which can be less effective and may require more bandwidth to compensate for errors.\n4. **Latency and Buffering**: Broadcast TV signals are transmitted in real-time, with minimal latency. Online streaming often requires buffering to ensure a smooth playback experience, which can introduce latency and affect the overall quality of the video.\n5. **Internet Infrastructure**: The internet infrastructure is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections, but it's not optimized for high-bandwidth, low-latency applications like HD video streaming. The quality of the internet connection, including factors like upload and download speeds, packet loss, and jitter, can significantly impact the streaming experience.\n6. **Content Compression**: Broadcast TV signals are often compressed using lossy compression algorithms like MPEG-2, which can reduce the bitrate while maintaining acceptable video quality. Online streaming often uses more advanced compression algorithms like H.264 or H.265, which can provide better compression ratios but may require more bandwidth to achieve the same quality.\n7. **Server-Side Processing**: Online streaming often requires server-side processing to handle tasks like content encoding, transcoding, and adaptive bitrate switching. This can introduce additional latency and affect the overall quality of the video.\n\nIn summary, the differences between broadcast TV and online streaming are due to the fundamental differences in the way they transmit and receive data. While broadcast TV uses a one-to-many approach with fixed bitrate and error correction, online streaming uses a many-to-one approach with variable bitrate and client-side error correction.",

A television broadcast is like talking into a loudspeaker system to address an entire stadium. Video streaming online is like holding an individual conversation with every person in the stadium simultaneously.",
            "There is some buffering when receiving video OTA, the buffering happens immediately after tuning. With OTA the stream is always there, and it's always on, all you have to do is grab the first decipherable packet and start deciding, you know the next one will be along immediately because it's guaranteed, furthermore if you drop a packet there is nothing you can do about it, so the stream is encoded to be able to continue with minimum disruption but obvious glitches. With internet streams the computer fetches a bunch of data because it doesn't know for sure when the next packet is arriving, the connection might at any moment stop delivering packets for a few moments, so you have to have sufficient data available to ride the gap and this riding the gap /can/ be invisible if you don't run out of buffer, so streaming video will pause and recontinue from the same location because in some cases you can do it without the user noticing. Why the gaps happen is because the internet is a series of pipes of different diameter.... the wire from your house to the exchange can handle less traffic than the wire from the exchange upstream, so obviously when you request a big file somebody has to rate limit the transfer because the internet itself isn't going to hold huge files in transit, the way that any part of the network shows it's over capacity is to randomly not transmit a packet - so YouTube thinks it's sent you the next instalment, but you never receive it, think of what this would do to a game of chess by post, how do you know that your move has been lost in the post? The answer is to resend your last move if you don't get a timely response, but this delay when viewing video causes skips. The most obvious restriction you can ease is the one between yourself and the exchange, buying fast internet means less dropped packets which means less stalls and a faster refill of your video buffer.",
            "Adding on to the other excellent answers here, I will add that traffic and contention are an issue. You are probably aware about how sometimes Internet traffic can get slower based on how many people are using it. This is a major cause of buffering with video streaming, because you're sharing almost the entire length of the connection with many other people. When you watch HD TV over the air, this isn't a concern. Nobody else is using that bandwidth. It's all 100% reserved for the television station. It's a specific frequency range that is legally reserved for them -- so they have all that bandwidth, every hour of the day, every day of the week. Also, it's broadcast, so your TV doesn't have to interact with the source of the transmission -- just pick up the signal and show it. This means that it doesn't matter if one person is watching it or a million. The full signal gets to you."

        "response": "The phenomenon you're referring to is commonly known as the \"pre-sleep emotional amplification\" or \"sleep-time emotional intensification.\" There are several theories that attempt to explain why emotions can be so amplified right before bed:\n\n1. **Hormonal changes**: The hormone cortisol, often referred to as the \"stress hormone,\" typically follows a natural circadian rhythm, with levels peaking in the morning and decreasing at night. However, in some individuals, cortisol levels may remain elevated in the evening, leading to increased emotional sensitivity.\n2. **Serotonin and melatonin**: The neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin play a crucial role in regulating mood and sleep. As the body prepares for sleep, serotonin levels decrease, and melatonin levels increase. This shift can lead to increased emotional sensitivity, as serotonin helps regulate emotional responses.\n3. **Brain's emotional processing**: Research suggests that the brain's emotional processing centers, such as the amygdala, are more active in the evening. This increased activity can lead to a greater emphasis on emotional experiences, making them feel more intense or overwhelming.\n4. **Memory consolidation**: During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, including emotional ones. As the brain processes these memories, emotions can become more vivid and intense, making them feel more amplified.\n5. **Stress and anxiety**: The evening can be a time of increased stress and anxiety, particularly if you're worried about the next day's tasks or have unresolved issues. This stress can amplify emotions, making them feel more intense or overwhelming.\n6. **Lack of distraction**: In the evening, you may be less distracted by external stimuli, such as work or social activities, allowing your emotions to take center stage. This lack of distraction can make emotions feel more intense or overwhelming.\n7. **Sleep pressure**: The longer you're awake, the more pressure you may feel to sleep, which can lead to increased emotional sensitivity. This \"sleep pressure\" can amplify emotions, making them feel more intense or overwhelming.\n8. **Individual differences**: People's emotional experiences and responses to stress can vary greatly. Some individuals may be more prone to emotional amplification due to their unique personality traits, life experiences, or coping mechanisms.\n\nKeep in mind that these factors can interact with each other and with individual differences to influence the amplification of emotions right before bed. If you're experiencing persistent emotional amplification, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional for personalized guidance.",

What am I going to do with all this space now? If it wasn't a mansion, would my house have been less expensive?\" During sleep, it is believed that memories formed during the day are being stored away into long term memory. Dreams are believed to be the signals that the brain picks up on and erroneously interprets as perception during this process. It seems as though stressful memories are more likely remembered, so you know how to deal with stress later, and dreams are accidentally a way for you to practice dealing with stress without the risk of failure. Also, scientists performed experiments with people falling asleep hooked up to brain scanners. During early stages of sleep, they were woken up, but they reported that they didn't feel like they even began to fall asleep at all. This suggests that awake/asleep is more like a sliding scale, and we don't always know how conscious we are. Therefore, when you try to fall asleep, your brain is probably already preparing to store away stressful memories and have a dream.",

        "response": "The problem of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was discovered in the 1970s. At that time, scientists were studying the ozone layer, which is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone (O3). Ozone is created when ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun breaks down oxygen molecules (O2) into individual oxygen atoms, which then combine with other oxygen molecules to form ozone.\n\nIn the 1970s, scientists began to notice that the ozone layer was thinning at high altitudes, particularly over Antarctica. This was a concern because the ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting the Earth from harmful UV radiation.\n\nIn 1974, a team of scientists led by Joe Farman, a British researcher, published a paper in the journal Nature that reported a significant decline in ozone levels over Antarctica. This discovery sparked a global concern about the health of the ozone layer and the potential risks to human health and the environment.\n\nFurther research revealed that the cause of the ozone depletion was the release of CFCs, which were widely used as refrigerants, propellants, and solvents. CFCs were found to be breaking down in the stratosphere, releasing chlorine atoms that reacted with ozone molecules, causing them to break down and deplete.\n\nThe discovery of the ozone hole and the role of CFCs in its formation led to a global effort to phase out the use of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances. The Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1987, aimed to reduce the production and consumption of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances, and to phase them out completely by the year 2000.",

        "input": "Would a centralized currency throughout the world work well, if at all?",
        "response": "A fascinating question! A centralized currency throughout the world, also known as a global currency, has been debated among economists, policymakers, and experts for decades. While it's an intriguing idea, there are valid arguments for and against its feasibility. Here's a balanced analysis:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Simplified international trade**: A global currency would eliminate the need for currency conversions, making international trade and investment more efficient.\n2. **Stabilized exchange rates**: A single currency would reduce exchange rate fluctuations, which can impact trade and investment decisions.\n3. **Increased economic integration**: A global currency could facilitate greater economic integration among nations, promoting cooperation and stability.\n4. **Reduced transaction costs**: With a single currency, transaction costs associated with currency conversions would be eliminated or significantly reduced.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Loss of monetary policy autonomy**: A global currency would require a centralized authority to manage monetary policy, potentially limiting individual countries' ability to set their own interest rates and fiscal policies.\n2. **Inequality and power imbalances**: A global currency could exacerbate existing economic inequalities, as some countries might have more influence over monetary policy decisions than others.\n3. **Cultural and economic differences**: A single currency might not be suitable for all countries, as their economic systems, cultural values, and financial systems differ significantly.\n4. **Risk of a single point of failure**: A global currency would create a single point of failure, making it vulnerable to economic shocks, cyber attacks, or political instability.\n5. **Difficulty in implementation**: Establishing a global currency would require significant coordination and cooperation among nations, which can be challenging to achieve.\n\n**Current alternatives:**\n\nWhile a global currency is not yet a reality, there are existing alternatives that facilitate international trade and investment:\n\n1. **Reserve currencies**: The US dollar, euro, and yen are widely used as reserve currencies, allowing countries to hold and use them for international transactions.\n2. **Special drawing rights (SDRs)**: SDRs are a supplementary foreign exchange reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to supplement countries' official reserves.\n3. **Digital currencies**: Digital currencies, like cryptocurrencies, are being explored as potential alternatives to traditional fiat currencies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile a centralized currency throughout the world is an intriguing idea, it's not a feasible solution in the near future. The challenges associated with implementing a global currency, such as the loss of monetary policy autonomy, inequality, and power imbalances, outweigh the potential benefits. Instead, existing alternatives, like reserve currencies and digital currencies, can facilitate international trade and investment while maintaining the autonomy of individual countries to set their own economic policies.",

            "One problem with a world-wide currency is neatly demonstrated by Greece and the Euro. One major way that a country can deal with hard times is to allow, or even force, their currency to be worth less. That makes the things you, as a country, make cheaper, and things you buy from other countries more expensive. So the country loses less money paying for exports, and makes more money selling its now cheaper exports. They can also create new money to pay for government spending, creating employment and pulling the country back onto its feet. If there is only one currency, a country can't do this. Their citizens keep buying imports, and their exports remain too expensive, and they can't recover without cutting back hard on government spending, which makes the hard times worse.",
            "A single currency isn't even working particularly well in Europe right now. Being in control of the currency is incredibly useful for a government. They can use the power to inflate or deflate the currency in order to deal with financial troubles, create a more favorable trading position, etc. Not being able to do these things can lead to serious problems. Imagine if you were a country with serious debts and a lagging manufacturing economy. It would really help to devalue your currency some. It makes your debts less valuable, and makes your manufactured goods cheaper for buyers. Now imagine you're in a currency union with a bunch of more economically successful countries and they don't want to devalue the currency. They want the currency strong, and tell you to pound sand. So now you're stuck with your debts getting bigger and bigger and your products getting less and less competitive and not a lot of options.",
            "Who would control the currency? Some would say the IMF or UN or similar. Those bodies are typically influenced by more powerful nations. A central world currency would be subject to manipulation to the benefit of the powerful and to the detriment of nations already lacking influence. Control of a nation's currency results in tremendous power and responsibility. Being able to set their own inflation and interest rates can build a nation or bring it to it's knees. Giving up that control is not to be taken lightly. One only needs to look at Greece as an example of what happens if a country moves to a centralized currency shared with other countries before it's ready. With major economic and corruption issues, Greece was forced into default on it's loans. Another country may have been able to print more money, causing inflation, but it would have allowed it to pay it's bills at the expense of the buying power of it's citizens. Greece, however, was unable to print more Euros on demand as they would have been able to do if they still used Drachmas.",
            "For a world currency to work, you'd also need world horizontal fiscal equalisation. Effectively an agreement that every person in every country will get equal access to Government services. Without HFE, you get Greece. With it, you get Australia.",
            "judging by the comments...there is little to no chance that the global currency would work...mostly due to the inability of local governments to fiddle with it. How do you explain the USA? There is a substantial differences between states and still the dollar seems to be functioning."

        "response": "The classic \"cop puts gun and badge on the table\" move!\n\nIn movies, this trope is often used to convey a sense of vulnerability and trustworthiness on the part of the interrogating officer. By placing their gun and badge on the table, the cop is, in a way, \"laying down their arms\" and signaling that they're not there to harm or intimidate the suspect. This can be a way to establish a sense of rapport and build trust with the suspect, making them more likely to open up and cooperate during the interrogation.\n\nAdditionally, this gesture can also be seen as a way to demonstrate the officer's professionalism and commitment to fairness. By putting their gun and badge on the table, the cop is showing that they're not there to use force or exert their authority, but rather to gather information and solve the case.\n\nOf course, it's worth noting that this trope is often used for dramatic effect in movies, and may not reflect real-life police procedures.

        "response": "There are several reasons why you don't feel like you're going fast while in an airplane, despite traveling at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (mph):\n\n1. **Lack of visual cues**: When you're on the ground, you're constantly bombarded with visual cues that help you gauge your speed. You see trees, buildings, and other objects whizzing by, which gives you a sense of velocity. In an airplane, you're typically looking out the window at a vast expanse of sky or clouds, which doesn't provide the same visual cues.\n2. **No sense of wind resistance**: When you're driving a car or riding a bike, you feel the wind resistance as you move. This resistance helps you sense your speed. In an airplane, the air is moving around you, but you're not feeling the resistance because you're inside a pressurized cabin.\n3. **No sense of acceleration**: When you accelerate in a car, you feel the force pushing you back into your seat. In an airplane, the acceleration is much more gradual and subtle, so you don't feel the same sensation.\n4. **Cabin pressure**: The air pressure inside an airplane is similar to the pressure at sea level, which helps to reduce the sensation of speed. If the cabin were at a lower pressure, you might feel more like you're moving quickly.\n5. **Psychological factors**: Our brains are wired to perceive speed based on our past experiences. Since most people don't have much experience with high-speed travel, their brains may not be well-equipped to accurately gauge their speed in an airplane.\n6. **The \"speed illusion\"**: This is a phenomenon where our brains tend to underestimate the speed of an object when we're inside it. This is because our senses are focused on the internal environment (the cabin) rather than the external environment (the outside world).\n7. **The \"motion parallax\"**: When you're on the ground, you see objects in the distance recede from you as you move. In an airplane, the objects outside (like clouds or buildings) appear to move past you at a constant rate, which can make it harder to gauge your speed.\n\nThese factors combined create the illusion that you're not moving very fast, even though you're actually traveling at incredible speeds.",
        "gold_answer": [
            "There aren't any forces acting on your body that would make you feel that way, except for when you are accelerating to/from that speed. Every part of the airplane -- your seat, the floor, the air in the cabin -- is moving at the same speed as you are, so there is no way for your body to tell.",
            "The Earth is hurtling through the air at many times that speed. We feel acceleration and deceleration, a change in speed, and you definitely feel the acceleration for the first 20 minutes of the flight or so as you take off and ascend. That's why you stay in your seat! Your seat is attached to the plane so it's *pushing* you up to the speed. They get to that speed gradually so it's not too uncomfortable. But once you're at cruising speed and altitude, everything in the plane is moving at the same speed as the plane, so it's like your not moving at all. Speed is relative.",
            "The human body is not great at sensing speed in general, only acceleration. We have a bunch of senses that all work together to let us know when we're changing speed or direction, but we have to rely on context clues to get a sense of constant speed. The next time you're in a car (as a passenger) close your eyes while the driver is going a constant speed on a straight road. You'll notice that it won't feel different from sitting in a parked car. Your sense of speed in a car is largely dependent on seeing objects in the distance and seeing how you move relative to those objects. When you're in a plane, you don't get that kind of feedback. Even with a window seat, objects are so far away that we don't have a good concept of how fast we're traveling. When you're landing and taking off, you start to gain a sense of speed.",
            "Also parallax; all the items moving relative to you are either so foreign (clouds) or so far away (ground), it's difficult to judge how fast you're moving relative to them.",
            "You and the air inside the craft all accelerate with the aircraft. As long as the aircraft maintains a relatively steady speed, there are no forces acting on you that would indicate you are travelling fast. Then looking out the window at altitude, objects on the ground are so distant that you don't have a good reference to know how fast you are travelling. The best time to see how fast you are travelling as at takeoff and landing when you have a better reference as to your speed with objects on the ground.",
            "Because you don't feel velocity. You could be going a million miles an hour and you wouldn't know it. What you feel is acceleration, a change in velocity. On an ordinary plane flight, this occurs at the beginning (during takeoff) and at the end (during landing). You also feel it when the plane changes direction, which also requires a chance in velocity.",
            "Speed doesn't create a force - acceleration creates a force. That's also the reason why you don't feel the force of the earth rotating on its axis, or revolving around the sun at 30 km/second. What creates a force is a *change* in speed, which is what acceleration is. Picture yourself in a stopped car. You're going 0 miles an hour. Do you feel any forces? Not really, you're sitting still, things are good. Now imagine you slam on the gas pedal, going up to 60 mph. Now you feel a *force* because your speed is changing - your body is pressed backwards against the seat by that force. Now you hit 60 and you ease off the gas, maintaining a nice freeway speed. Do you feel any force while you're on the freeway? No, you feel just about the same as you did parked - if you opened a window you could feel the air moving, but inside of your car, everything is just the same as if you were going 0. Except now, slam on the brakes. You're decelerating and changing speed - a force pushes you forward, straining against the seatbelt. Once you hit 0, that force is gone. An airplane works the same way - you accelerate up to 600 mph slowly, so that the force isn't too overwhelming, but once you hit that speed and stop accelerating, it feels just the same as being still on the ground. Aside from any bumps or turbulence, which (just like in a car) change your acceleration by a little bit and affect you as forces.",
            "In an airplane, you don't have much of a frame of reference. The cabin is usually sealed off, so you don't experience the sensation of plane moving through air. Planes try to keep a pretty steady path. Which means you experience few forces due to acceleration once away from the airport. Planes fly pretty high off the ground. If you look out the window, you might be able to make out a few houses or cars at the ground level, moving pretty slowly across your massive plane of view. Their movement means nothing to you, thousands of feet above the ground or any other stationary object."

Here's what would likely happen:\n\n1. **Initial collapse**: As we start digging, the Earth's crust would initially collapse into the hole, creating a massive trench. The weight of the overlying rocks and soil would cause the trench to deepen and widen.\n2. **Mantle flow**: As we approach the Earth's mantle, the hot, viscous rock would start to flow into the hole, filling it with molten rock. This would create a massive, slow-moving lava flow that would eventually solidify, forming a new, molten rock layer.\n3. **Core disruption**: When we reach the Earth's core, the intense heat and pressure would cause the liquid iron-nickel alloy to flow into the hole, potentially creating a massive, global-scale volcanic eruption. The core's magnetic field would also be disrupted, leading to a temporary loss of the Earth's magnetic field.\n4. **Planetary instability**: The sudden removal of a significant portion of the Earth's mass would cause the planet's rotation, orbit, and axis to become unstable. This could lead to:\n\t* Changes in the Earth's rotation rate, potentially causing extreme weather patterns and tidal waves.\n\t* Alterations to the planet's orbit, potentially affecting the climate and the stability of the Earth's axis.\n\t* The possibility of a catastrophic event, such as a massive earthquake or a global-scale volcanic eruption.\n5. **Atmospheric loss**: As the hole reaches the surface, the atmospheric pressure would drop significantly, potentially causing a massive loss of atmospheric gases, including oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. This could lead to a significant reduction in the planet's habitability.\n6. **Global cooling**: The removal of a significant portion of the Earth's mass would also cause a global cooling effect, as the planet's energy balance would be disrupted. This could lead to a prolonged period of cold temperatures, potentially even a new ice age.\n7. **Long-term effects**: In the long term, the hole would continue to affect the Earth's geology, causing changes in the planet's tectonic activity, volcanic activity, and even the formation of new landmasses.\n\nIn conclusion, digging a straight hole from one side of the Earth to the other would have a profound impact on our planet, causing widespread destruction, geological upheaval, and potentially even altering the planet's habitability.

            "What would happen to the Earth? Probably nothing. If you made an instantaneous hole through the Earth and it wasn't being supported by anything, gravity would cause the solid core to fill the space immediately. The mantle will also fill in immediately. It would be like asking what would happen if you drilled a hole in the ocean. There might be a small earthquake that we can detect but that's about it. I'm not sure what will happen to the crust. Either you would have a very deep hole with a lava plug at the bottom, or a volcano. The earth has thousands of them, and the man made ones will probably be smaller than most, as it won't be over a hot spot or along a plate boundary. It would probably leak lava for a few days or weeks then stop and become extinct. Nothing that would affect very many people. If you could some how shield your hole to keep it form collapsing, nothing would still happen. The hole is too small and earth is too big. Gravity has to do with the mass of the planet, and the mass wouldn't change, or change by much, depending on what you did with the material in the hole, piled it up or simply disappeared it. The magnetic field also wouldn't be affected. Your hole is too small. If you had a hole a couple hundred miles across, you might get some of the apocalyptic effects you are looking for, but for a smaller hole, even one a mile wide, nothing exciting would happen.",
            "Simple answer: a perfect and in-destructible hole all the way to the core would start to spew hot liquified material through it. The gravity force on the outer layers would put pressure on the core which would force material through the hole. Edit1: I'm correcting myself based on the comments I have received. Edit1: The material might cool before it reaches the surface. That answer depends on the design of the hole. Edit1: Assuming the material did not solidify, the material would flow until is approximately reaches the surface. Once it gets close to the surface, the weight of the material in the column (hole) would balance out the gravitational pressure. There might be a bit of spew due to the momentum of the material. Since the core is denser than the rest of earth, on average, the material level would settle below earth's average surface. Edit1: I do not know if there is a place on earth where the surface is so far below the average that spewing core-material could happen. I would speculate something in the deepest trenches of the sea but that may not be the \"deepest\" place in this case. Since the earth diameter is smallest pole-to-pole then that might be \"deepest.\" Edit1: ~~Whether the material cools and seals the hole before raining death upon the planet is beyond me but I will speculate:~~ Edit1: ~~I would guess that, since the earth we still exist, then the hole would cool and seal up before raining massive destruction upon us. But...if the hole is insulated then there might be unimpeded flow to the surface.~~ Even if there is unimpeded flow to the surface, the next question would be whether the cooling at the surface caps the flow. ~~Again, since we still exist,~~ Since we still exist, the most likely answer is that the surface cooling would abate the flow.",

The diameter of the hole is also extremely significant because, as you know, the earth rotates and land migrates. If the size were, say, 2 miles in diameter then it would surely cause fantastic earthquakes, tsunamis, and cyclones because the tunnel will collapse upon itself within 56 hours. With the core exposed the level of radiation would actually be enough to terminate at least 40 percent of the populations and up to 70 percent depending on where the tunnel (or hole) is.",
            "Well there's only one way to find out for sure... Gentlemen, grab your shovels, we're about to science.",
            "No actual materials can stand the absurd pressures, but suppose you build a tunnel through the center of the earth and its walls are made out of unobtanium and won't either melt, collapse, bend or suffer any other alteration. The Earth's core is a ball of solid metal the size of the moon. The problem is that this ball is rotating slightly faster than the surface. The tunnel would be lodged firmly in the core and would appear to be moving at about 10 meters an hour, shredding the crust as it goes along, cutting through it like a knife, drawing two giant east-west circles at the surface points of the tunnels. There wouldn't necessarily be volcanic activity (think you're on a floating ice slab and you drill a line in it with a power tool - water still doesn't come out because you're still floating just like continents float on a giant lake of molten rock inside the Earth), but there would definitely be earthquakes and volcanos might still errupt if the pressure below the crust happens to be high enough.",
            "The solar wind blowing across the holes would cause a shrill, ultra-low-toned whistling, causing stellar whales and astral elephants to ram the planet in fearful anger. This would usher in the universe's first Age of Rage. Nestle would make a commemerative chocolate bar, and there would be a new cricket team with a relative name in Pune, India.",
            "This is really a question better put to AskScience, but according to my geologist father, nothing would happen. First, a man-size hole (or even car- or house-size) would be infinitesimably small compared to the earth itself. It's like wondering why all the water in your skin doesn't run out of your pores. Second, such a hole, made the way you describe, would in effect be a continuing part of the surface (mathematically speaking), since you can't admit any part of the interior without destroying the hole. You would indeed require extremely strong tools and materials, greatly exceeding the capabilities of anything we have. If that was possible, and you were able to make the hole, then the hole would, for practical purposes, not be a hole into the earth, but a tunnel from one side to the other, around which the interior would flow (and not likely notice it, due to the enormity of comparative scale). And if you *did* admit the interior, the hole would immediately fill with whatever matter was at the level you admitted, and then cool solid at the top. You probably would get some lava and such at first, depending on where you do it, but it would seize solid soon enough, and you'd be left with an interesting feature. Unless, as others have suggested, the hole is extremely large, in which case, sure, it could be dramatic. But this is like asking what happens if you hit the earth with larger and larger stones. Somewhere between nothing and oblivion is a Michael Bay movie, but it's not especially interesting even as a thought experiement, since it only points to various points on the curve of possibilities, rather than frame a more interesting question with more variables.",
            "I have read a couple of books that had this scenario. It really depends on what kind of hole you're talking about. But here's the one I really remember: If you had a 3-foot diameter hole that went from one side of the earth, straight through the center to the other side, with an impervious material lining the walls of that hole, not much of anything would happen. if you then vacuum-sealed that hole, and put a near-frictionless car and rail system inside, you would have an extremely low-energy transport from one side of the earth to the other. It would be quite a fast trip, starting with the approximately 32.2 feet per second per second \"free fall\" acceleration, and gradually decreasing to the center, then gradually increasing to bring you to a cushy, 1g stop on the other side of the planet. This is entirely hypothetical, and completely undoable with today's technology. However, a hole that size through the center of the Earth would have negligible effect on anything else on the planet. Like sticking a hypodermic needle through the center of a grapefruit.",
            "As you probably know Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of molten iron in the Earth's core. Digging through the core would no doubt disrupt this motion, and weaken if not destroy our magnetic field. No magnetic field means almost certain extinction of life on Earth. Bummer. Assuming our magnetic field was left intact, the question of where the material from the hole would end up arises. Wherever it was, a lot of the Earth's mass would now be there, which might skew the Earth's gravitational pull. I'm not an expert so I'm probably wrong. I'd love to hear an answer from someone who knows what they're talking about though. Very interesting question indeed.",

            "I'm actually having a lot of fun with this, so I think this warrants a direct reply. First issue I see is that the cylinder would need to be filled with air. Some have suggested this would cause weather disturbances, and it might. I don't think it'd be big though. Assuming a 1m cylinder, the total volume would be about 0.08km3. That's pretty small, in terms of atmosphere. 1.0x10-9 % of the atmosphere. I'm not a meteorologist, but i don't think that'd cause anything other than a stiff wind for a while. This assumes a constant pressure, which is, of course, not realistic. The pressure is actually a bit of a monster. For curiosities sake, I'm playing with it. If you just do a straight exponential calculation, assuming the mechanics all the way down are the same as on the surface, you'd get 2.145x1013 kPa. That's 20 000 000 000 the surface pressure, and more than enough to create what's called a supercritical fluid. At those pressures, the gases would actually \"condense\", but not in the conventional sense. It's a very strange state of matter that's tough to ELI5. However, this is not the case. Earth is not a point mass, and the gravitational force pulling on the air column would not be constant. So I'll fiddle with the calculus a bit more for fun, and let you know what it comes out to. [EDIT: I worked it out as far as I could, but apparently I broke WolframAlpha trying to solve it. So we may be out of luck here.] As for the magnetic field, I did't read anything that'd say it would be an immediate issue. Our magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core, which is driven by tidal forces caused by the Sun. A 1m radius tube would likely not cause a significant disruption here. The core is a problem though. The dynamics of the inner core are not well know, but most geologists agree that it's a solid (some imply a highly compressed liquid that acts solid, and a few other theories, but solid core seems to dominate). So we've just drilled a hole through a solid core. A core that has a faster angular rotation than the surface. So one of two things would happen: either the core would continue to rotate, and we would lose the tube pretty quick, or the core would stop relative to the surface. Not imagine how much angular energy is stored in a rotating, massive, sphere of highly dense nickel-iron alloy. That would all need to go somewhere.I don't know exactly how it'd be dispersed, but it would be like trying to stop a huge flywheel, and the results would likely be catastrophic. Extinction event catastrophic. The last issue, all the rest aside, comes down to temperature and radiation. The Earth's core is in the ballpark of 4 000K (about 4 300C, or 7 800F). There is no known substance that could shield from that heat, or any cooling method to avoid melting/combusting pretty much anything thrown in. Then there's the radiation. I couldn't find any exact numbers on concentration, so it's tough to find an exact dose. However, the Earth as a whole is estimated to produce 20TW of radioactive energy. So I'll go out on a limb and guess that the level would be past the lethal dose for a person, and probably irradiate any inorganic object going through. Let's assume that all this is a non-issue, for fun. Just to examine the timeline of jumping in. Since we are ignoring the fatal pressures, temperatures, and the like, let's just assume a complete vacuum. The number most people use to traverse the diameter of the planet is about 42 minutes, which isn't too bad (This number would not be affected by equatorial bulge, and would not have any significant difference due to elevation changes. Height is not a variable in a perfect pendulum). You'd hit about 11 000m/s at the core, assuming constant acceleration (some people are saying 8 000m/s. Not the number I got, but either way, it's crazy fast). Now, as you probably know, a perfect pendulum will reach exactly the same height at which it was dropped. Same for you. The elevation variations in the Earth's surface vary by about 0.22%. Not enough to make a significant difference in travel time, but definitely enough to make an impact on your arrival. So you'd likely fall short and oscillate infinitely. If there was any source of energy loss, you'd eventually settle at the core, experiencing zero G. Doesn't sound fun to me. However, you would also have angular velocity. Since the radius of rotation decreases with the descent, your relative lateral velocity would increase, and you'd end up riding the side of the tube all the way down, like a slide. Even though it's straight down, you'd fall kind of like it's angled. By the time you hit the core, all of the lateral energy would be gone. As you ascended, you'd now have *less* angular velocity than the tube, and slide all the way back up. Obviously, all this friction is a huge problem, and would pretty much destroy any hope you had of reaching the other side, unless we extended the hypothetical to include a frictionless tube. TL;DR This would be a very bad thing. You'd either destroy the planet, waste a lot of resources for something that wouldn't last, or inevitably become stuck in the core of the Earth forever. So let's not build this, okay? EDIT: Please feel free to review my statements. What I've found is hardly the gospel truth. Some of the theories I referenced are not completely accepted, some of my math may be off, and some is wild speculation. I mostly did this because I answered a few points, started digging, and then this behemoth formed. Also, apologies for it not all being completely ELI5, or for what likely may be a few spelling/grammar errors. This was just done on the fly between classes.",
            "Well if its an indestructible hole, I would assume lava can't spew out of it because it wouldn't be able to get into it. If its not truly indestructible, the hole would close up pretty quickly. Not because of lava cooling, but because of gravity  URL_0  The really interesting thing is the way it would \"pin\" plate tectonics. It would cause a lot of earthquakes as the continents shifted around these two points. Inner lawyers wouldn't have an issue because they tend to be much more fluid and can move around the hole.

My question is more focused on the fact that at some point, you would stop digging down and be digging up. Im so confused by this.

        "response": "What a fascinating question! Having a sense of smell is a unique and multifaceted experience that can evoke strong emotions, memories, and sensations. Here's an attempt to describe what it's like:\n\n**A Symphony of Scents**: When you have a sense of smell, your brain receives a constant stream of chemical signals from the environment, which are interpreted as a vast array of scents. It's like listening to a symphony, where each note, chord, and melody represents a specific fragrance. The combination of these scents creates a rich tapestry of aromas that can evoke emotions, memories, and associations.\n\n**A Window to the Past**: Smells have a remarkable ability to transport us back in time, evoking memories from childhood, special events, or significant moments in our lives. The scent of freshly baked cookies might remind you of your grandmother's kitchen, while the smell of saltwater might bring back memories of a beach vacation. This phenomenon is known as \"olfactory-evoked memory,\" where the sense of smell is closely linked to the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for forming and storing memories.\n\n**A Multisensory Experience**: Smell is often closely tied to other senses, such as taste, sight, and touch. When you smell something, you might also experience a corresponding sensation in your mouth, a visual association, or a tactile response. For example, the smell of freshly cut grass might make you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin or the sensation of the blades of grass beneath your feet.\n\n**A Filter for Reality**: Our sense of smell helps us navigate the world by filtering out irrelevant information and highlighting important cues. For instance, the smell of smoke might alert you to potential danger, while the scent of freshly brewed coffee might signal a welcoming atmosphere. This filtering process is essential for our survival and well-being.\n\n**A Source of Joy and Comfort**: Smells can bring us immense joy and comfort. The scent of a loved one's perfume or the aroma of a favorite food can evoke feelings of happiness and contentment. In fact, research has shown that the sense of smell is closely linked to the brain's reward centers, releasing dopamine and endorphins when we encounter pleasurable scents.\n\n**A Complex and Subjective Experience**: The sense of smell is highly subjective and influenced by individual experiences, cultural background, and personal preferences. What one person finds pleasant, another might find unpleasant. This subjectivity adds to the richness and complexity of the sense of smell, making it a unique and personal aspect of our human experience.\n\nIn summary, having a sense of smell is a multifaceted experience that combines sensory perception, emotional resonance, and cognitive processing. It's a window to the past, a filter for reality, a source of joy and comfort, and a complex and subjective aspect of our human experience.",

            "I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind. Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound. I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles. Maybe you can get a general feel for what people are saying by watching lips (so long as they face you), but you miss out on the effects of the background music for setting mood and all the foley effects. [Edit: Missing a word.]",
            "Smelling is a function of the brain, as you know. It lets me know I am alert. It taps into the primal part of self. I am able to place locations like certain streets or kitchens by smell. I can know the scent of another person and know that they have been.

But sometimes I smell a smell I am expecting. Like my farts. I love the smell of my farts.",
            "for want of taste, smell is best compared to touch. a truly foul odor is very much like having a mild acid in your sinuses. courtesy of menthol and similar compounds in cleaning products, things that smell \"clean\" are best compared to a feeling of cold.",

            "Many of the responses here deal with the emotional response that smelling something produces. I think that's good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there's still a link in the chain there that's missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I'm sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn't explaining anything that you don't already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that's just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I'm a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I'm keenly aware of them and they can't be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can't ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That's generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren't overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you're just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don't linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after.",
            "to smell is a gift and a curse at the same time. Overwhelming scents can be devastating such as a skunks spray while others such as the aroma of a fine wine can be uplifting.",
            "I read an article about a woman who had a magnet in planted in her finger. This resulted in a new sense where she could feel magnetic flieds (like microwave ovens, high voltage lines, etc.) and detect near by metal. Thinking about this completely alien sense helped me to consider my other senses more objectively. So being able to smell actually gives you information about the chemistry of objects. Consider all the chemical reactions that take place in cooking; they result in differnt smells (and tastes). Smell can also tell you if fruit and vegiyables are ripe or even spoiled. Likewise of meat goes bad it give off a smell - kind of a warning. So you can think of that as being smiliar to being able to see or hear that information - since you get it from a distance. It it probably more similar to hearing since it doesn't require direct or uninterrupted \"line - of - sight\". Off all my senses, smell is the one that most often conveys bad information. For like in the case of spoilage, the smell is revolting. Like a loud sound, or a bright light. Smell is a really strong trigger for memories too. For many people smelling cookies reminds them of home. Or maybe certain foods remind them of holidays. The part of the brain that processes olfactory (smell) information is closely associated with memories. Because smell gets stronger the closer you get to the subject, it often times draws me in for smells I like (good food, a woman with nice colonge, the smell of the woods, etc.), or drives me away for ones I dislike (spoilage, feeces, filth, body oder, too much fragrance, etc). As a parent of small children, smell is one way I know my kids needs a clean diaper. Often times he\\she will get cranky (audible) or show other visual signs. The smell is another queue. My mother in law has no sense of smell, so she would always stick a finger in the diaper to veifiy - which is messy. I just look when I am unsure. Generally speaking smell is a way we learn things not to eat. There are some poisons that are adapted to smell good or not at all, but very few things that smell bad that are good for you (individual tastes aside). So smell is just another way to collect information at a distance from the world around us. Most of that information can be collected other ways too. Especially if you took chemistry and have isolated different compounds and elemtents. Smell is just a convenient way to do that.. Edit: hit post early.",
            "A good smell is like feeling something very pleasant and soothing. It often elicits memories, as smell is very strongly tied to memory, and you may find yourself back in a happy childhood memory. The smell of bread in the oven would immediately transport your mind back to being a small child, helping your grandmother bake in the kitchen and feeling like the world was amazing and the day would last forever. It's a very visceral, all-over feeling when one is enveloped by a familiar, pleasant smell. You feel your body open up to pull it in, your eyes close and you salivate involuntarily, and everything around you slows just a little bit. Think of it a little like being in the afterglow of a good orgasm. Conversely, a bad smell is not as often tied with memory but creates a very physical response just the same. You'll feel your throat close as you gag, and your stomach churn or heave. The smell feels viscous and heavy in your mouth, as though it's tangible and you've bitten down on it. It seeps into you, burns a little, and feels thick and wet in your throat like you're choking on something slimy.

Starring Dan Aykroyd, Eddie Murphy, Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche, Denholm Elliott, and Jamie Lee Curtis, the film tells the story of an upper-class commodities broker (Aykroyd) and a poor street hustler (Murphy) whose lives cross when they are unwittingly made the subjects of an elaborate bet to test how each man will perform when their life circumstances are swapped.\nHarris conceived the outline for Trading Places in the early 1980s after meeting two wealthy brothers who were engaged in an ongoing rivalry with each other. He and his writing partner Weingrod developed the idea as a project to star Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. When they were unable to participate, Landis cast Aykroyd—with whom he had worked previously—and a young but increasingly popular Murphy in his second feature-film role. Landis also cast Curtis against the intent of the studio, Paramount Pictures; she was famous mainly for her roles in horror films, which were looked down upon at the time. Principal photography took place from December 1982 to March 1983, entirely on location in Philadelphia and New York City. Elmer Bernstein scored the film, using Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera buffa The Marriage of Figaro as an underlying theme.\nTrading Places was considered a box-office success on its release, earning over $90.4 million to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the Uni",

        "response": "The scheme at the end of the movie involves Louis Winthorpe III (Aykroyd) and Billy Ray Valentine (Murphy) working together to buy up orange juice futures at a high price, causing the Duke Brothers' bet to backfire and their fortune to be ruined.",

            "The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit.",

In a nutshell, they were buying contracts that afford them the legal right to purchase units of OJ at a specific price. Since they knew the price of OJ would fall (remember the dude with the locked briefcase?) they were buying option contracts to purchase OJ at a higher price. Anyone with half a brain would sell them these and of course that's what happened. For in depth knowledge, look up \"how futures trading works.\"",

Spots in a commodity pit are protected like gang turf. They just go in and stand in the middle. Also if they deposit the cash from everyone's savings lets say 100k and the margin per contract is 5k per contract they can only buy or sell 20 contracts. I don't know what the FCOJ margins are, but if they trade more than 20 the profit goes to the exchange. At least that's how the CME rolls.",

They all look at the clock and then 9am (I think) strikes and crop report is read. Then they all panic because they need to unload whatever they bought and finding the 2 buying they sell ASAP. Again how can these 2 buy everything with so little money? 3. Finally the closing bell strikes and trading stops. How did all this scheme happen so fast ? Doesnt trading happen 9:30am to 4pm at NYSE (why wtc was shown?) for such commodities. Did they spend that many hours there? It just seemed sudden and abrupt the time flow.",

In reality I think it would've been the firm that they trade through and that provided them the loan in the first place. (margin call means pay back the loaned amount) edit: maybe I had it backwards and the dukes were going to go long on OJ futures, but it's the same principle. margin call did them in after the market worked against them based on their false knowledge.",

The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.\nThe statue is a figure of a classically draped woman, likely inspired by the Roman goddess of liberty Libertas. In a contrapposto pose, she holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.

After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.\nThe idea for the statue was conceived in 1865, when the French historian and abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence (1876), the perseverance of American democracy and the liberation of the nation's slaves.

        "response": "The documentary stations you mentioned, such as History, Discovery, TLC, and Nat Geo, did not suddenly abandon documentaries for reality TV. Instead, they evolved their programming strategies over time to adapt to changing viewer habits, technological advancements, and shifting market demands. Here are some key factors that contributed to their shift towards reality TV:\n\n1. **Ratings and audience engagement**: Reality TV shows often attract larger audiences and generate more buzz than documentaries. By incorporating reality TV into their lineups, these networks could increase their ratings and attract a broader audience.\n2. **Competition from cable and streaming services**: The rise of cable networks like A&E, Bravo, and E! (which focused on reality TV) and streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime (which offered a wide range of content, including reality TV) forced traditional documentary-focused networks to adapt and compete for viewers.\n3. **Changes in viewer behavior**: With the proliferation of online video platforms and social media, viewers' consumption habits changed. They began to prefer shorter, more bite-sized content, such as reality TV shows, over longer, more in-depth documentaries.\n4. **Increased production costs**: Documentaries often require significant investment in production, editing, and research. Reality TV shows, on the other hand, can be produced more quickly and cheaply, making them a more cost-effective option for networks.\n5. **Merchandising and branding opportunities**: Reality TV shows often lend themselves to merchandising and branding opportunities, such as spin-off shows, merchandise, and licensing deals. This added revenue stream became an attractive incentive for networks to prioritize reality TV.\n6. **Evolution of documentary formats**: While documentary-style programming didn't disappear, the formats and styles of documentaries evolved. Many documentary-style shows now incorporate elements of reality TV, such as competition, drama, and personal stories, to make them more engaging and appealing to a broader audience.\n\nIn summary, the documentary stations didn't abandon documentaries entirely, but they did adapt their programming strategies to incorporate reality TV and other formats that could attract larger audiences and generate more revenue.",

            "Alright, sit yo ass down and get ready for a story. The TLDR is indeed ratings and production cost. But if that's the why, we must ask ourselves \"why now?\" What happened to these stations, and why did it all happen at the same time? Well, the seed of change (or pestilence if you wanna be poetic) is TLC. Before The Channel Formally known as Learning gave us child beauty pageants and whatever the fuck Honey Boo Boo is supposed to be. You see, in 2007 Discovery was kind of in a hole. As you may know Discovery owns, TLC, Nat Geo, Animal Planet and more. Despite their wide net, the brand was tanking. So they brought in a man from NBC (who would soon sell out to Comcast) to liven things up. The Discovery Channel store was closed, the main station started doing documentaries more fit for history channel with \"True crime\" exploitation pieces. This would in turn hemorrhage viewership from History (A sister network of A & E) who began showing programs like Gangland. Modern Marvels (which had existed since 1995) got a shiny update, and the content of the History Channel become the closest content rival for Discovery. But then, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, or more accurately here comes TLC's shit shows. Ya see, part of the way Discovery was able to have so many networks was appealing to different demos for each one. History had been nailing the males over 40 crowd and discovery had been shooting for educated younger males. TLC was basically discovery channel marketed to women in their early 20s to early 30s, and you know what bored women of that age-range were watching? Soaps, MTV/VH1 reality shows and celebrity gossip. Taking a \"documentary\" series about child fashion shows and editing it like an MTV reality show with a healthy bit of exploitation (the fans of these shows are watching to laugh at these people, make no mistake) and they suddenly had a the right ingredients for what would become a network of cheep, exploitative, schlock across all Discovery Networks (well, except the Science Channel). So What really happened? What really changed? Demographics. Say what you will about these networks being crap, they do a good job of not internally fighting with each other for attention. The Honey Boo Boo crowd doesn't want much to do with \"are Megladon's still around\" the age range, income level, and general education of the demo they're trying to reach can be reliably expected to enjoy the TV click bait. They figured out something Buzzfeed did before you wanted to inexplicably punch it in the face: people don't want to learn, they want to have what they know and like confirmed. This is how Discovery Channels' most profitable stretch, year after year, is telling people sharks aren't violent murder machines (except when they are but it's okay because not to people) like it's the first time anybody has heard this information. Apologies to Shark Week fans, but how surreal is it that the most educational thing on the network is telling a demographic that didn't grow up with Jaws shit they already know from last year? And then there's history channel. History is, again, owned by A & E not discovery. History is a tougher nut to dissect. In short, as they became more direct competition for Discovery they began duplicating what was making discovery successful. Deadliest Catch became Ice Road Truckers, bad speculative science docs became Ancient Aliens. History duplicated the pacing of TLC and marketed it to men, but dumbed its content down to turn the stuff with potential to be good into a filter for Discovery Channel's scraps. A & E went the way of TLC and now theirs no real market incentive to change. If you really want to know whose to blame, look in the mirror. The original demographics have moved on. We're watching Netflix and are simply too educated to watch a show about convergent mermaid evolution. Discovery says they're gonna start making quality programming again, so demand might be returning as Millennials get more disposable income (Oh right, the other big reason! Because of the whole recession thing, cheaper shows became a must and Gen-Xers aged 34-48 had more money than the groups they were, on paper, marketing towards so include this disclaimer in the paragraph about TLC's market shift) and educated young people starting families in their late 20s is presenting itself as a important demographic to snag. In short: The Economy tanked around the same time as the networks underwent massive internal restructuring. Networks that were in mild competition with each other entered a full race to the bottom and neither one went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.",

As the Declaration of Independence says:  > We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In other words:  > It is obvious to all of us that every human being is born equal, and that all of us are born with certain fundamental rights that cannot be taken away; some, but certainly not all, of these rights are the right to be alive, the right to be free, and the right to choose how to live your life. The Constitution does not give us our human rights -- they're granted to us upon birth by God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever you believe to be the source of fundamental truth. Everyone has these rights. American or foreign, bad people, good people, your worst enemy. Saints, criminals, murderers -- everyone is born with fundamental rights and they *cannot be taken away* by human beings, because who are we to remove a gift bestowed by God? Because these rights are inherent, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights don't provide them; rather, the documents provide *prohibitions on the government* from infringing on the exercise of these fundamental rights we are all born with. The Founders believed that the best government would be one that honored and protected its citizens natural rights. Now, some infringement of our rights is necessary to provide for social welfare and order, but even here, it's more about balancing the exercise of our rights; e.g., when you deny a criminal his right to freedom in order to protect other people's right to live free of physical harm. These rights are distinct in the Constitution from the Privileges  &  Immunities of citizenship, which *are* the things that we are granted as Americans. These include things like the entitlement to vote, to travel freely between states, and to have free access to commercial markets. These privileges *are* granted by the government and *can* be taken away. The Constitution recognizes the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. So, yes, illegal immigrants have that fundamental right -- they were born with it, just as you are. However, as I said, the Founders and the Constitution recognize that complete anarchy leads to greater infringement on human rights (because the strongest just takes over as tyrant), so the government is allowed enact reasonable regulations that infringe on fundamental rights to the extent that they are necessary to protect social order and welfare.

        "response": "What a fascinating question!\n\nThe sensation of feeling \"love\" as a heavy feeling in the chest is a common phenomenon, often described as a warm, fuzzy, or even a \"butterfly\" feeling in the chest. There are several theories that attempt to explain this phenomenon:\n\n1. **Dopamine and Oxytocin**: When we experience love, our brain releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, reward, and attachment. Oxytocin, often referred to as the \"cuddle hormone,\" is also released, promoting feelings of bonding and attachment. These chemicals can cause a physical sensation of warmth and heaviness in the chest, which can be misinterpreted as a feeling of weight or pressure.\n2. **Vagus Nerve Stimulation**: The vagus nerve is responsible for regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and other bodily functions. When we experience strong emotions like love, the vagus nerve is stimulated, causing a physical response in the chest, such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating, or a feeling of heaviness.\n3. **Emotional Intensity**: Love is often characterized by intense emotions, which can manifest physically as a heavy feeling in the chest. This is because the brain's emotional centers are closely linked to the body's autonomic nervous system, which regulates physical responses to emotions.\n4. **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, particularly during romantic love, can cause physical sensations in the chest. For example, the hormone prolactin, often associated with feelings of attachment and bonding, can cause a feeling of fullness or heaviness in the chest.\n5. **Cultural and Social Conditioning**: Our cultural and social environments can influence how we perceive and experience emotions, including love. The idea that love is a heavy, overwhelming feeling may be perpetuated through media, literature, and societal norms, shaping our expectations and experiences of love.\n\nWhile the exact mechanisms behind the feeling of love as a heavy sensation in the chest are still not fully understood, it's likely a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and cultural factors.",

        "response": "What a classic philosophical conundrum!\n\nThe question \"How can we know that we are awake?\" is a variation of the problem of self-awareness and the nature of consciousness. It's a challenge to our everyday experience and our understanding of the world.\n\nThere are a few ways to approach this question:\n\n1. **Empirical evidence**: We can rely on our senses to tell us that we are awake. We can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell the world around us. We can move our bodies, feel the sensation of gravity, and experience the passage of time. These sensory experiences provide strong evidence that we are awake and interacting with the world.\n2. **Internal experience**: We can also rely on our internal experiences, such as our thoughts, emotions, and feelings. We can introspect and reflect on our own mental states, which provides a sense of continuity and coherence. This internal experience is often referred to as \"qualia\" or the \"subjective experience.\"\n3. **Social interaction**: We can also rely on our social interactions with others. We can communicate with others, share experiences, and engage in activities together. This social interaction provides a sense of shared reality and reinforces our understanding that we are awake and interacting with the world.\n4. **The problem of dreaming**: Some philosophers argue that the problem of knowing we are awake is closely tied to the problem of dreaming. If we can't be certain that we are not dreaming, then how can we be certain that we are awake? This is known as the \"problem of dreaming\" or \"the problem of the dream argument.\" One possible response is that even if we are dreaming, our experiences and perceptions are still real to us, and we can't distinguish between reality and dreams.\n5. **The limits of knowledge**: Finally, we can acknowledge that there may be limits to our knowledge and understanding. We may never be able to know for certain that we are awake, but we can still operate on the assumption that we are. This is a pragmatic approach, recognizing that we can't know everything, but we can still make decisions and act in the world based on our best understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while we may not be able to prove that we are awake with absolute certainty, we can rely on a combination of empirical evidence, internal experience, social interaction, and the limits of knowledge to support our understanding that we are awake and interacting with the world.",

With that said, there are a few ways to discern whether or not you are in a dream. I've toyed around a bit with lucid dreaming, and have gotten confused a few times. 1. Look at at writing or at a clock. Note what the writing says or what time it is. Look away. Look back. If the writing is different, or the time is more than a few seconds off, you're dreaming. 2. Trace your steps back as far as you can. In a dream – even an extremely vivid, lucid one – you get stuck at some point and can't remember anything before that. While awake, you can trace your whole day back to when you woke up in your bed, then the day before, then the week before, etc. 3. Ask yourself if you're in a dream. Concentrate on your surroundings. Even if you're in a familiar place, is it how you remember it being? Are the physics around you the same? What about the behavior of those around you? 4. Hold your breath for as long as you can. If you can go on without feeling the urgent demand for air, you're dreaming. If you *are* dreaming and realize it, then you are in a [lucid dream]( URL_0 )! Go nuts, have fun, do whatever you want!

            "A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, it's certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google \"Xenu\" or \"Thetans\". There's a fairly recent book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it's gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you. But with so much social media these days I think they've had a hard time applying pressure on-line like they used to. **TL;DR** - It's mostly crazy bullshit, but *profitable* crazy bullshit.",

This reduced financial burden allowed them to focus on other aspects of their lives.\n3. **More job security**: In the past, jobs were often more secure, and employees had more benefits, such as pensions and job security. This reduced financial stress and allowed people to plan for their futures with more confidence.\n4. **Slower pace of life**: The pace of life was generally slower in the past. People had more time to enjoy their daily routines, spend time with family and friends, and engage in hobbies without the constant pressure of modern technology.\n5. **Less information overload**: With the rise of the internet and social media, we're constantly bombarded with information, news, and updates. Older generations didn't have to deal with this level of information overload, which can be overwhelming and stressful.\n6. **More community support**: In the past, communities were often closer-knit, and people relied on each other for support. This sense of community and social connection was often stronger than it is today.\n7. **Less pressure to constantly consume**: Older generations didn't have the same pressure to constantly consume and keep up with the latest trends, products, and services. They might have been more content with what they had and less focused on material possessions.\n8. **More time for leisure**: With fewer distractions and less pressure to constantly be productive, older generations often had more time for leisure activities, such as reading, gardening, or spending time with loved ones.\n9. **Less emphasis on material success**: In the past, people might have placed less emphasis on material success and more on personal fulfillment, relationships, and community. This shift in values can lead to a greater sense of happiness and contentment.\n10. **More time for self-reflection**: With fewer distractions and a slower pace of life, older generations often had more time for self-reflection, contemplation, and personal growth.\n\nOf course, every generation has its unique challenges, and it's essential to recognize that these advantages don't mean that older generations had an easy life. They faced their own set of difficulties, such as poverty, war, and social inequality. However, by acknowledging these differences, we can gain a deeper understanding of the experiences that shaped our world and work towards creating a better future for ourselves and future generations.",

Your union gives you the kind of leverage to make sure you don't get screwed over the way CEOs have leverage to get golden parachutes. This is before there starts being backlash not against the exorbitant golden parachutes for the insulated, coddled executives, but against the leeches trying to put food on their tables asking for a raise to compensate for inflation and asking that their pensions not be ransacked or taken away.

In my market, the bay area, that doesn't happen without significant family help or a lucky IPO. This basically means that I had to become an expert in the various low down payment options and tax write-off programs and so on and so forth just to be able to serve more than some small percent of my own generation.

You can't really plan long term because you really don't know what will happen. You could save for that house or car, just put down the payment, and lose your job that day, no warning.

            "For much of the postwar 20th century, if you were a young white man with at least a high-school education, you had to try *not* to get a job that would fund at least a lower-middle-class lifestyle. If you had a college degree in *anything*, even English or Art History, you were pretty much guaranteed a lifetime of desk jobs, each higher-paying and more powerful than the last, with The Firm, which would then take care of you through retirement with a pension. If you came into The Firm with a Bachelors, it might actually pay your time *and your tuition* for a Masters. When you went home at the end of the night, work was generally over - there was no email. Calling someone at home was a big deal and used mostly for emergencies. (This era is largely where the perception that the unemployed are just lazy comes from. There really was a time when you had to be lazy to be unemployed.) Nowadays, you need to get into a good elementary school that will prepare you to work hard in middle school so you can take the right classes in high school to get into a good college in a handful of the \"right\" majors, and then maybe go to graduate school, to stand a *chance* of getting a good job if you're also a friendly/interesting person who interviews well. Outside a handful of labor markets, your health insurance and retirement plans will be token benefits (if they exist at all). You'll need to hit the streets, blast your resume around, write a ton of cover letters, and practice your interview game so you can change jobs every few years to increase your salary with your experience. Employers certainly aren't handing out meaningful raises just for showing up. Your bosses may expect you to answer your cell phone or respond to texts/emails promptly late into the night. For blue-collar workers, much of this can be attributed to globalization and automation. For white-collar workers... as just one example, many corporations needed what was basically database functionality long before databases existed. A whole lot of middle-class lives were funded to replicate what I can now do for 15 minutes of setup and $5/month: Postgres on a virtual machine. It also turns out that people in low-cost-of-living countries are just as good at a lot of menial computer-operating tasks. Firms are also getting more and more efficient. It turns out that a lot of the time, you can lay off an entire layer of people who do nothing but have meetings with each other all day and the firm makes just as much money. You can have a \"corporate culture\" of \"passionate\" people who work 10 more hours a week for the same salary and hire 20% fewer of them. On the other hand, if you're *not* a white man, life now is probably a great deal more manageable than it was back then.",

They literally found him, and offered him the job because they needed someone. He says that he cant imagine trying to survive in the job market the way it is these days. But its worth remembering that the way things are now isnt unique to the present day. If you look back at history before the 1940s, most people were just as financially insecure, and had as much trouble finding stable well-paying work as they are today. Its just that the Baby Boomers had the luck to live in times where demand for labour was reasonably high, and the economy had whole new sectors that had never existed before become major sources of employment and wealth. tldr; The baby boomers had it reaaaally good.",
            "In the US young people have the problem of a changing nature of labor and the contract between worker and corporation. In past few decades wages have not increased with respect to ~interest rates~ inflation, in many ways they have decreased. This means we get a larger number in terms of dollars from the companies we work for, but we receive far less value for our work. So we have to work more. We work for smaller firms generally, shops and retail, tinier operations that make unionizing and collective bargaining less viable strategies for supporting our labor's value. A major reason for the existence of unions was to combat the spreading de-humanization of work, which simply put took satisfaction out of labor and alienated people. Additionally, they helped support labor in national politics. By and large people born in the past 20 years will never join or support a union, and won't be able to offer each other support for their livelihoods. This means goods are slightly cheaper, but labor is cheaper still, so we have to work more to stay solvent. Gains in women's rights and expanded diversity have slightly offset the effects of wage stagnation, but the crisis of 2008 shows us that we won't get back to the state of the mid-90s labor. The minimum wages your parents worked for briefly as youths are the wages you will work for until you are middle-aged, when you briefly make more and then get fired and have to work for minimum wages again (on average). In the past century our labor has become a substantial portion of our identities. If you write a story about someone, the thing they spend time doing to make money is probably the first thing you use to describe them. This is Jim, an accountant, or Mary, an engineer, or Sanjeet, a flight attendant, etc. Well, now your profession will last 15 months, on average. You will change jobs many times in your lifetime as a replaceable cog in a variety of machines that don't care about you. Oh, and you won't be able to retire on the average person's wages. You'll get no pension, and once you are fired for being less productive than a computer the company you worked for will forget you ever existed. All your work will have your name scrubbed from it and your impact on the world will be indistinguishable from the person in the cubical next to yours (on average). edit: Thank you DrunkHacker.",

            "I think this is a misconception about our generation. We are spoiled and arrogant in a lot of ways and we talk like we're the most important generation ever, but I don't often hear anyone saying the old generations had it easier. We're very aware that having to deal with the depression, WWII, Korea, Nam, and many other things must have sucked way worse than anything we've been through. If you go back further, it sucked even worse. I can't even imagine getting drafted and forced to go kill people and probably die in WWII, or even worse Viet Nam. Iraq has been pretty messed up, but there was no draft and far less American deaths than previous wars. One thought I often have about these generation discussions is how we are all quite the same. Human beings do not inately change from one generation to the next, we just respond to our environment. Whatever our strengths or flaws, the previous generation has made us what we are, so we should try to get along.

Global competition is tough, especially since American kids aren't keeping up with math or science as well as countries such as China or Singapore. Back in the day, you didn't have to worry about kids pulling ahead you who live 5000 miles away. Today, they compete with you. Why choose you, when employers can hire someone in India to do the same thing for much less? Less manual intensive jobs are available today. Companies don't need so much manual labor today, as they did 30 years ago. If they do need a labor intensive job to get done, it is sent east to East Asia for cheap labor. This is true for things like manufacturing and assembly. More jobs are automated in general. You don't always need people to get the job done. You can get a computer to do the same thing. Why call up a travel agent when you can go to Priceline or Expedia? Self checkout lines? Basically what I'm saying is that there were more (good) employment opportunities back in the day. Being lazy today is worse than being lazy back then. You need to put in a lot more effort to live well today than our parents and grandparents had to.

            "When we talk about that we're talking about the post war generations. A few things happened in America that was completely unprecedented. One, most the the industrialized world was in ruin except for the United States, this led to a large number of high paying private manufacturing jobs. Two the United States vs. the Soviet Union made it necessary for large government expenditure and expansion, this also created jobs. Three, women retreated from the work force after the war creating more demand for labor. These three things made it extremely easy to find good paying work. Now, lets look at housing. Housing cost from post war until about 1975 rose, roughly, with inflation. In the mid 70s the price of housing started to outpace inflation, this has accelerated so that a house in 1970 that would have cost 100k(adjusted for inflation) would have cost 200k in 1990, and today that exact same house would run half a million. These are national numbers, there are certainly places in America where this isn't the case, but it's true in most places. Next is education. I'll keep this one easy. In 1960 it cost roughly $9500 in inflation adjusted dollars to attend an ivy league school. It now costs over $40,000. That's quadrupling of tuition, the price of books and the aforementioned housing has also gone up significantly more. Well, there's three factors. There's more, but you get the jist of it.",

As the Ice Bucket Challenge proved campaigns for awareness cost nothing. As for breast cancer specifically, the reason it seems so prevalent is just the marketing, as far as cancers go it is nowhere near the most deadly, nor most common, but it IS the most marketable. And has the most successful marketing plan, think about it, how many \"specific cancer\" months can you name most of the big ones have a month but none with the prevalence of breast cancer. Women in the USA make far more purchasing decisions than Men so it is not a stretch to think that buying power hasn't reached to charitable endeavors as well. So breast cancer has high visibility, and I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, just that it, is, a thing. The fact of the matter is that raising breast cancer awareness can be an effective vehicle for general awareness of all cancers. And if you are looking for a worthy charity to donate to I recommend finding a local one that focuses on improving lives of actual people with disease. Donations to fraudulent groups like Komen are just lazy.",

            "I'll say something other than the conspiracies (however much truth there may be) here. Awareness is so much more than making someone aware of beat cancers mere existence. Awareness is about knowing and recognizing the signs in yourself and others, so that the disease can be detected early, and thus be more easily treated. For example, I bet most people who have heard of breast cancer haven't heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It's a rare form of breast cancer that forms in sheets instead of lumps. By the time it's detectable as a misshapen breast, is usually already at stage 4. Another example is that men can and do get breast cancer. Most men don't realize this, and would have absolutely no idea how to monitor for it. That's another part of awareness: knowing who is at risk. Most people only know that lumps = breast cancer. But there are many kinds that manifest in different ways. Awareness helps (or should) people understand more about the disease, not just make them aware that it exists. This should be the case for most cancers, but breast cancer gained traction due to its prevalence in modern America, and organizations like SGK getting the word out. P.S. Try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when talking about breast cancer awareness. There are shady people trying to profit off it, sure, but there are also a lot of people out there who this cause is very important to, and are trying to help with nothing but the best intentions. My sisters and I are considering starting a charity for IBC awareness and research, in honor of our mother who died from it. We've already hosted a few fundraisers whose proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. There are people out there trying to help. I'm one of them. TL;DR: Awareness means knowing who is at risk, why, and recognizing signs of multiple forms of the disease. It's not meant to simply make you aware of the diseases existence.",
            "There are a lot of highly voted aggressive neckbeard comments. While they we not entirely incorrect in facts, they are false in the response to the question. The main reason is awareness and clarity. People don't get checked. They get cancer and then it's too late. If you get frequent checks you might prevent cancer or find it at a point that it can be removed. Terminal cancer is often found too late and could have been prevented. Since the awareness month and company campaigns, breast cancer deaths HAVE went down, and prevention has went up. That result is good and has saved the life's of your mothers, sisters, and wife's. So what if komen pays its ceo 85% of all the earnings. Some companies focus on awareness and the promotion of the message instead of actual research and that does result in life's saved. All it takes is that pink shirt or commercial to get that stubborn woman to get a check. Plenty of other companies over pay their CEOs and higher up while doing nothing for the community and saving no life's. Look at the positives, and if you know the facts, donate to different charities like the research programs themselfs but don't ask for the abolishment or harass the ones like komen, because without them we have a lot less awareness and advertisement. You can have the best researchers with the most funding on the world but without awareness they have no one to cure.",
            "As a breast cancer survivor (at least for now), the Komen campaign for breast cancer awareness has made me hate the month of October. 31 days of non stop pink and give for the cure bs. Truth is the same amount of women die from BS today as 30 years ago. No where close to a cure. They do fund some things like mammos for poor women but the amount of money spent by people buying pink stuff is way more than is spent on research. I truly wish they would make a rainbow ribbon for ALL cancers so there would be no favortism because really, all this fundraising hasn't really helped those who have/had it.",
            "There was a time when people with certain diseases were seen as weak, or generally lesser people. A lot of the awareness stuff just kind of normalizes this. It lets people know that survivors are people you know. They are your family, coworkers, classmates, people all around you. They can lead valuable lives. We should not forget about them, and we should not look down on them either.",
            "Seems like there are many cynics out here. It's true there are many parasitic organizations that capitalize on our charity and good will, but the fact is that breast cancer is one of the many cancers where death is preventable if caught in early stages. This is alongside cervical (get your pap smears at 21 ladies, and HPV vaccines for everyone), prostate for men (older men should do digital rectal exams), and of course lung (stop smoking). It's a little unfair to say that breast cancer is the only one getting awareness when all these other cancers are also getting attention. I think breast cancer was the first big movement because you are able to do a self-exam and that is empowering to women, so it is now the biggest (btw the main reliable screening tool is regular mammographies, so self-exams are a start, but not sufficient). Just to provide a scale of the problem, more than 50% (a half!) of women will develop a benign breast lesion. Fortunately most of these are not lethal and should not progress to a malignancy. More than 10% of women will develop a true malignancy, where your odds of survival are almost exponential the earlier you catch it. So it's kind of important to make it common knowledge how to find a lump in your breast, because there's a chance that it might kill you. That's not to deny the aforementioned parasitic organizations. I guess the best advice is find a good charity of your choice and ignore the bad ones, but don't hate on the movement as a whole because it is trying to make a difference for the American public.",
            "It's actually a symptom of a larger problem with some charities and social organizations. Many of these organizations form to combat a real problem, with a noble goal. They get donations, hire a staff, and all work hard toward it. But then the taboo is broken, the awareness is raised, and it becomes a part of society. But now what do you do with the organization they built up? For something like breast cancer awareness, their mission is complete. The public at large knows about it, and pays attention to the changing recommendations about it. But are they going to just tell their staff \"Alright everybody, we won! Show's over, you're all fired.\" Of course not - The people working here will \"Goal creep\" and look for new things to do to legitimize their organization. The benefit now is to them, to sustain their own organization. It doesn't really serve much of a public good anymore, which is why you see all the hatred for it from those who have researched it.",
            "A lot of it is for commercial reasons - breast cancer research is \"big money\", even if we really aren't any closer to developing a cure than we were 60 years ago. I'd have to try and find the link, but I think I remember reading that only a small percentage of the money raised even goes to research. Most of it goes to advertising and the millions of dollars worth of salaries for the higher-ups. There was an infograph I saw on ifuckinglovescience about a year ago that showed the deadliest diseases versus how much funding they received. Breast cancer may have just barely broken the top 5 of deadliest diseases, yet it received about 6 times more funding than the leading killer disease. Here's the graph:  URL_0 ",

            "The Komen Foundation is getting a lot of flak ITT, as they should, but I think most people are not answering your question, which might be better understood as, \"Why does the Komen Foundation behave as it does?\" It is because of the difficulty of funding non-profit organizations. As you might be aware, most non-profit organizations have to divide their resources between administration and their cause. What you might not be aware of is that a lot of the administrative costs go toward finding more funding. Unless a non-profit has a stable stream of income from committed donors, grants, or an endowment, every non-profit is in constant pursuit of more sources of revenue. This often means hiring a professional grant writer and hosting some sort of open house or gala that informs and solicits donors. Even stable non-profits will probably be constantly pursuing more revenue to further their cause and expand their programs. The Komen Foundation decided to try a for-profit marketing campaign in order to get revenue. The people they hired advised them to have an ambitious advertising campaign with the justification that it would bring in a lot more revenue than it cost. It cost a ton of money but it was wildly successful, so they have kept it up and followed those strategies. The obvious downside is that an inappropriately large percentage of their budget goes toward marketing, which increases awareness but does not create a cure. The upside however, is that they have raised more funds for their cause than they would have otherwise.",

            "This is a two-fold answer for me. 1: 'Awareness' is a euphemism for money. Ideally research money, but people make a profit on the research as well. When you say you are raising money, it puts people off. When you say you are raising awareness, people are more likely to be involved because their is not cost. 2: Saying you are raising awareness allows people who make no physical contribution to feel like they are doing something important, when all they are doing is sharing something on social media. They are \"raising awareness\" and pat themselves on the back, when really they are just being arm-chair activists. That is not a bad thing.

Like when adverts remind us to fill in tax returns, we all know about it but can easily ignore it. So being reminded will keep it in out minds to do it sooner.

Prostate cancer is just as deadly and many men die from it each year yet very little is done about it from a fundraising perspective. This can be argued because it's a cancer that affects privileged men VS under privileged women. Supporting womens causes is seen as progressive.

Every ingredient in a product that ends up for sale is considered and chosen for that recipe based on freshness dates. If certain ingredients are not as fresh then the 'sell by' date is changed. Potato salad with all fresh ingredients gets, say, three days on the shelf before the mayo goes off. That's basically universal, so extended shelf life means added salts, maybe sugar or vinegar but usually salt. So if your local deli has takeout potato salad and they say it's good for 2 days refrigerated and Wal-Mart has a tub of it but it's good for 6 days and we can assume similar ingredients ( they don't have magic mayo ) then it's a guarantee the extra 4 days come from the massive amount of added salt.",
            "There are a few different dates that get put on food, and they have different meanings. **Sell by** - mostly meaningless to consumers. A note for the store to discard the food after this date, but it's often a week or more before the food goes bad. Ignore this date, or add a week to it. Your milk probably has this date on it. **Best before** - a note for the customer. Quality can't be 100% guaranteed after this date, so you can't sue if it's not up to par, but it's still edible. **Use by** - this is a real one, but it only means quality may degrade after this date. If it smells okay, it's likely still safe. However, all of the above applies to ***unopened*** food. Once you open it, you introduce bacteria and humidity, and if you don't store it properly the date on the package doesn't matter. There are different ways food goes \"bad\" once it's opened: - **Stale/dry:** The flavor or texture is changed by the air. It doesn't taste the best, but it's not bad for you. - **Rancid:** Oils go bad. Some oils are prone to going bad from oxygen, heat, and light. Not only do they taste and smell bad, but they can chemically harm your body. - **Contaminated:** Bacteria grow when there's water or moisture. The bacteria can make you sick, and many bacteria (like botulism) make toxic wastes. Cooking it well kills the bacteria, but cooking won't get rid of the toxins. - **Moldy:** Fungus grows when there's moisture. If you see fuzzy mold or weird colors *anywhere* on the food, it's everywhere in the food. Throw it out. Now, back to the milk. The date on the carton is likely the \"sell by\" date, not an expiration date. Once it's home, add a week to get a better expiry date. Regardless of the date, if you haven't opened it yet, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. If you opened it in the past week and kept it in the fridge, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. It's been in the fridge open for more than a week... bacteria may have gotten in. Pour a bit into a cup and give it a smell. Your nose is good at detecting when something is off. **If it smells ok, it's probably good to cook with.** Cooking will kill off any bacteria and reset the expiration date. Cooking will likely fix stale or dry food too. You can put stale tortilla chips in the oven and they'll be good as new. You can cook with milk beyond its date if it smells fine. **If it looks or smells weird or gross, don't cook with it.** Cooking can kill bacteria, but it can't get rid of the toxic wastes from the bacteria or fungus, and it can't fix any rancid oils. However, you should know that if you're immune system is suppressed (old, very young, pregnant, or otherwise vulnerable to infection) then you should definitely keep to the printed \"use by\" dates and don't eat things after a few hours at room temperature or a few days in the fridge.

They would then work inside that new operating system to develop all their necessary features and components (a gui, applications, accessories), and then compile that full operating system into a boot disk, that you would buy today.",
            "The operating system used to program does not have to be the same as the target operating system. Using a cross compiler, and proper libraries, you can compile for a different operating system or even different processor type. See also  URL_0 ",
            "It is important to realize that current operating system from MS are very much an assemblage of a large number of parts. Many of these parts either don't change much from version to version all that much. So it is not like they have to rewrite everything all at once. It seems they start out with making changes to the core and once that runs halfway well they use their development on that to upgrade al the other parts. Early previews of new Windows versions often still have a host of features from the previous version that have not yet been updated or deleted."
