Reich's contributions to the development of minimalism have had a profound impact on the music world, influencing generations of composers and musicians.\n\nReich's early work was heavily influenced by the avant-garde and experimental music of the 1950s and 1960s.

But what exactly causes this phenomenon, and what role do specific compounds in cannabis play in its occurrence?\n\n**The Culprits: THC and Cannabinoids**\n\nThe primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is responsible for the characteristic \"high\" associated with cannabis use. However, THC is not the sole contributor to bloodshot eyes. Other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG), also play a role in this effect.\n\n**The Physiological Mechanism**\n\nWhen cannabis is consumed, THC and other cannabinoids bind to receptors in the body, particularly in the eyes. This binding causes a dilation of the blood vessels in the eyes, leading to increased blood flow and a characteristic redness or bloodshot appearance. This effect is often accompanied by increased tear production, which can exacerbate the redness.\n\n**The Role of Histamine**\n\nHistamine, a neurotransmitter involved in allergic reactions and immune responses, also plays a crucial role in the development of bloodshot eyes. THC and other cannabinoids stimulate the release of histamine, which in turn causes blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood flow and redness.\n\n**Other Factors",

The attack, which was intended to prevent the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese expansionist policies in Southeast Asia, led to a formal declaration of war by the United States against Japan.\n\nHowever, the United States was not the only country to declare war on Japan in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack. On December 11, 1941, Germany and Italy, who were already allied with Japan through the Tripartite Pact, declared war on the United States.\n\nThe country that declared war on the United States four days after the attack on Pearl Harbor was Germany. On December 11, 1941, Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, issued a declaration of war against the United States, citing the U.S. embargo on oil exports to Japan and the U.S. presence in the Pacific as reasons for the declaration.\n\nItaly followed suit, declaring war on the United States on the same day. The declarations of war by Germany and Italy marked the beginning of a new phase in World War II, as the conflict expanded from a European conflict to a global war involving multiple continents and nations.\n\nThe declarations of war by Germany and Italy were motivated by a desire to prevent the United States from interfering with their own expansionist policies in Europe and Africa.

The Nuremberg Trials, which took place from 1945 to 1949, further solidified this perception, as top Nazi officials were held accountable for their crimes.\n\nHowever, as the years passed, a more nuanced view of Hitler and his regime began to emerge.

Others viewed him as a symbol of German resistance against the Allied powers and the Soviet Union.\n\nCurrent Public Opinions:\n\nToday, public opinions on Hitler and his actions in Germany are more complex and multifaceted.

I am pretty sure I have seen footage at least once a day. Third, I have never been in a place where people are so quick to defend a person being verbally or physically attacked by another person. On the train I have seen many altercations (verbal) that generally ends with the asshole being called out by at least two other people (sometimes the entire train car gets pissed). So they aren't generally ones to stand by and let that shit happen. That being said it has caused some issues. In Germany it is illegal to argue facts of the Holocaust in public. The official story has not changed in a long time even with new data and facts present. Historians can lose their jobs or be arrested for trying to argue on the side of truth. So, there is that. It has also made racism a very difficult thing to talk about. No one wants to talk about the fact that German citizens with Turkish parents are still treated like subcitizens ....but they are. Lastly, this does not mean that Germans don't have a sense of humor about Hitler. I would, however, suggest that if you crack a Hitler or Holocaust related joke that you know the person you are talking to very well and refrain from doing so in public. People are very vigilant when it comes to anything Nazi related. Graffiti is covered quickly after the police are contacted. Edit: to be clear Germans dislike Hitler. There is no type of worship on the part of the German people..some even still feel guilty. Some don't like joking about him.

            "An economist would say healthcare has a [positive externality]( URL_0 ). You can look at it like this: * The amount a person buys of a good (eg doctor visits) is based on how many they want and how much they can afford. This is referred to as the **private benefit**. * There are some things you can buy that make everyone better off. For example: going to the doctor every time you are sick will make you less likely to make other people sick. This is referred to as a **public benefit**. * Because only the private benefit is taken into account when someone is buying something, people buy less of a good than is **socially optimal** (private benefit + public benefit) * Governments give money to people so that they will buy more of these goods in order to make everyone else feel better (ie get closer to the socially optimal amount of consumption). Positive/Negative externalities are the driving force behind a lot of government policy. Edit: Formatting",

I don't understand why it is such a big deal in the USA. Yes, government tax revenue pays for healthcare. The rest of us in the first world have been doing this for decades. Ask whether Government should provide free schooling for those same freeloading poor people? And free roads too for those too poor to use private toll roads? Some people will always pay for private schools and Hospitals etc, but that doesn't mean free options shouldn't exist also. For the record, I am an Australian with private health insurance.

However, his actions led to a series of legal and political consequences that ultimately prevented him from returning to the United States to face charges. In this article, we will explore the legal and political reasons why Snowden could not return to the US and why he opted for asylum in Russia instead.\n\nLegal Reasons:\n\nSnowden's leak of classified information was deemed a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917, which makes it a crime to communicate national defense information to anyone not authorized to receive it. The US government charged Snowden with three counts of violating the Espionage Act, as well as theft of government property and unauthorized communication of national defense information.\n\nThe legal hurdles facing Snowden were significant. The US government had already revoked his passport, making it difficult for him to travel to the US to face charges. Additionally, the government had also charged him with treason, which carries a maximum sentence of death. Given the severity of the charges, it was unlikely that Snowden would receive a fair trial in the US.\n\nPolitical Reasons:\n\nThe political climate surrounding Snowden's case was also a significant factor in his decision to seek asylum in Russia.

            "[In his own words]( URL_0 ):  >  A number of detractors have suggested that if Snowden, who disclosed controversial top-secret N.S.A. programs to reporters, truly wanted to commit an act of civil disobedience for reasons of conscience, then he should have faced the legal consequences, making his case to the American public while standing trial at home.  >  When I asked why he didn’t take this route, Snowden said that because of the way national-security laws have been interpreted since September 11, 2001, he believed that the government had deprived him, and other whistle-blowers, of ever having the opportunity to make their cases in this time-honored tradition. Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, “It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.”)  >  Snowden said that he would “love” to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, “I have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they’re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I’m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so. But they’ve declined.”  >  Instead, Snowden said, “They want to use special procedures. They want a closed court. They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.” So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn't believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a \"show\" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently.",
            "No one has mentioned this yet or at least not very succinctly: The crime he is accused of (Violating the Espionage Act of 1917) doesn't allow you to defend yourself and the Supreme court has previously ruled this is not a violation of free speech.

Even if SCOTUS finds what the NSA did to be illegal, it still wouldn't exonerate him of his crime.",
            "He could, but he's afraid that he would lose. Which is reasonable, seeing as he almost certainly would. Even *if* we make the incredibly generous assumption that there's no corruption in the American government, and that there's no incentive to protect the NSA, Snowden still committed a crime. Someone else doing something illegal doesn't usually give you the right to also do something illegal. So it's entirely possible that while the NSA will be penalized for their actions, so will Snowden. And that's really the best case scenario, seeing as there *is* likely incentive for the government to protect the NSA. Or worse, there might be actual *justification* for the NSA's actions, which will seriously hurt any of Snowden's defenses. So even if he gets a fair trial he'll probably be found guilty, and it's certainly a reasonable fear that he wouldn't get a fair trial. Coming back is really a no-win scenario for him.",

Snowden let the public know what was going on. The powers that be call this treason and would like to do to him what was done to the Rosenbergs. Up to this point the government sounds both reasonable and consistent. Later, however, we find out that the Chinese are doing the same thing, as are the Brits, the Russians, and basically any country that bothers to do so is in fact doing so.

            "I just thought of something. Couldn't the defense argue that Snowden cannot be charged with violating the Espionage Act as he leaked the classified documents to Wikileaks, which is not a hostile government but closer to a corporation?

            "Well Billy, it's like this... When you're young, being an adult seems like a really great thing. You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there's all that naughty stuff you're not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what \"they want to be when they grow up\". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don't really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You've got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you've got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You've also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you've got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don't pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you're not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you've never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you're going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it's going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can't afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there's all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won't, but... there's a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you're not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you've ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won't ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don't have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it's not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn't make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don't have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It's a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren't so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve. That's part of why people are depressed, Billy. And that's all without mentioning the wars and the suffering and the poverty in countries other than our own, places we would like to help because they're people just like us... but we're too busy struggling to get by ourselves, to really help them as much as we'd like. Grown up life is hard, Billy. I'm sorry.",

Sometimes medications help to make it harder for the brain to tell them to be depressed. That said, there are basically two types of depression, there is situational depression (and this usually has a large component of sadness with it) and there is chronic depression which is not really a \"sadness\" as much as a feeling of apathy and a lack of motivation.

In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of overtime pay, exploring how it works for employees and the financial implications for companies that offer it.\n\n**How Overtime Pay Works for Employees**\n\nUnder the FLSA, non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay for any hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. Overtime pay is calculated as 1.5 times the employee's regular hourly rate, which means that employees receive 50% more pay for their extra hours worked. For example, if an employee earns $25 per hour, their overtime pay would be $37.50 per hour.\n\n**Notable Exceptions**\n\nNot all employees are eligible for overtime pay.

This phenomenon is not unique to your camera or phone, as many selfie cameras produce images with this characteristic. But why does this happen, and why don't rear cameras exhibit the same behavior? To understand the answer, we need to delve into the history and technology behind camera design.\n\nThe reason selfie cameras produce horizontally flipped images lies in the way they are designed. Selfie cameras, also known as front-facing cameras, are typically mounted on the top or bottom of a device, facing the user. This design allows for a more natural and convenient way to take selfies, as the camera is positioned to capture the user's face. However, this design also means that the camera's sensor and lens are reversed, resulting in a horizontally flipped image.\n\nIn contrast, rear cameras are designed to capture images of the world outside the device, typically facing away from the user. These cameras are mounted on the back of the device, allowing for a more traditional and intuitive way to take photos. Since the camera is not facing the user, there is no need for the image to be flipped horizontally.\n\nAnother key factor contributing to the horizontally flipped image is the way the camera's sensor and lens are designed.

However, as societal attitudes towards child-rearing evolved, concerns about the long-term effects of physical punishment on children's physical and emotional well-being began to grow.\n\nIn the 1990s, a growing body of research emerged highlighting the negative consequences of physical punishment on children's development, including increased aggression, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem. This research sparked a national debate about the effectiveness and morality of physical discipline, with many advocating for a shift towards non-physical forms of punishment.\n\nIn 2007, the New Zealand Parliament passed the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act, which effectively repealed the section of the Crimes Act that allowed parents to use reasonable force to discipline their children.

This period is critical, as it marks the beginning of the embryo's journey to develop into a healthy fetus.\n\n**The Process of Implantation**\n\nThe process of implantation begins when the fertilized egg, now called a blastocyst, travels through the fallopian tube and into the uterus. The blastocyst is made up of two main parts: the inner cell mass, which will develop into the embryo, and the outer layer of cells, which will form the placenta.\n\nAs the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it begins to burrow into the uterine lining, a process facilitated by specialized proteins and hormones. The blastocyst's outer layer, called the trophectoderm, secretes enzymes that help break down the uterine lining, allowing it to implant more easily.\n\n**Factors Affecting Implantation**\n\nSeveral factors can influence the success of implantation, including:\n\n1. **Hormonal balance**: Hormones such as progesterone and estrogen play a crucial role in preparing the uterine lining for implantation.\n2. **Uterine receptivi",

Despite the widespread availability and effectiveness of vaccines, many vaccinated individuals still worry about the possibility of their children being exposed to and contracting diseases from unvaccinated children. This concern is rooted in a complex interplay of factors, including the dynamics of herd immunity, the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases, and the role of unvaccinated individuals in the transmission of diseases.\n\nHerd Immunity: A Shield Against Disease\n\nHerd immunity is the concept that when a significant percentage of a population is immunized against a particular disease, it creates a protective barrier that prevents the spread of the disease. This is because even if some individuals are not vaccinated, the majority of the population is immune, making it difficult for the disease to spread. However, when a significant number of individuals are not vaccinated, the herd immunity is compromised, leaving vulnerable individuals, such as those with compromised immune systems, at risk.\n\nThe Spread of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases\n\nVaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and whooping cough, are still present in many parts of the world.

However, that child can still get the measles. Similarly, say you have a kid who has been otherwise sickly, or is one of the rare, but not unheard of kids for whom the vaccine doesn't take. Or say you're an old person whose immune system has simply weakened overall. In any of these cases, the unvaccinated child is a danger.",
            "There is also the chance of enough un-vaccinated people acting as a \"breeding chamber\" for the illness, allowing it to mutate and infect vaccinated people. Considering the long duration before a new vaccine can be made and given out, this is a pretty damnable risk.",

While both methods allow us to enjoy high-quality video content, there is a significant difference in their requirements for smooth playback. This article will explore the reasons why over-the-air HD TV transmission requires no buffering, whereas streaming HD video online demands a good internet connection and high bandwidth.\n\nHistorical Context\n----------------\n\nTo understand the difference, it is essential to look at the history of television broadcasting. Over-the-air TV transmission has been around for decades, with the first commercial broadcasts taking place in the 1940s. In the early days, TV signals were transmitted using analog technology, which was prone to interference and degradation. The introduction of digital television (DTV) in the 1990s marked a significant improvement, as it allowed for higher quality and more reliable transmission.\n\nOn the other hand, online streaming is a relatively recent phenomenon, with the first streaming services emerging in the late 1990s. Initially, streaming was limited to low-quality video and audio, but the advent of broadband internet and the development of streaming protocols like HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) have enabled high-quality streaming.\n\nKey Factors\n------------\n\nSo, what are the key factor",

A television broadcast is like talking into a loudspeaker system to address an entire stadium. Video streaming online is like holding an individual conversation with every person in the stadium simultaneously.",
            "There is some buffering when receiving video OTA, the buffering happens immediately after tuning. With OTA the stream is always there, and it's always on, all you have to do is grab the first decipherable packet and start deciding, you know the next one will be along immediately because it's guaranteed, furthermore if you drop a packet there is nothing you can do about it, so the stream is encoded to be able to continue with minimum disruption but obvious glitches. With internet streams the computer fetches a bunch of data because it doesn't know for sure when the next packet is arriving, the connection might at any moment stop delivering packets for a few moments, so you have to have sufficient data available to ride the gap and this riding the gap /can/ be invisible if you don't run out of buffer, so streaming video will pause and recontinue from the same location because in some cases you can do it without the user noticing. Why the gaps happen is because the internet is a series of pipes of different diameter.... the wire from your house to the exchange can handle less traffic than the wire from the exchange upstream, so obviously when you request a big file somebody has to rate limit the transfer because the internet itself isn't going to hold huge files in transit, the way that any part of the network shows it's over capacity is to randomly not transmit a packet - so YouTube thinks it's sent you the next instalment, but you never receive it, think of what this would do to a game of chess by post, how do you know that your move has been lost in the post? The answer is to resend your last move if you don't get a timely response, but this delay when viewing video causes skips. The most obvious restriction you can ease is the one between yourself and the exchange, buying fast internet means less dropped packets which means less stalls and a faster refill of your video buffer.",
            "Adding on to the other excellent answers here, I will add that traffic and contention are an issue. You are probably aware about how sometimes Internet traffic can get slower based on how many people are using it. This is a major cause of buffering with video streaming, because you're sharing almost the entire length of the connection with many other people. When you watch HD TV over the air, this isn't a concern. Nobody else is using that bandwidth. It's all 100% reserved for the television station. It's a specific frequency range that is legally reserved for them -- so they have all that bandwidth, every hour of the day, every day of the week. Also, it's broadcast, so your TV doesn't have to interact with the source of the transmission -- just pick up the signal and show it. This means that it doesn't matter if one person is watching it or a million. The full signal gets to you."

While the University of St Andrews is often credited as the oldest university in Scotland, Eton College has its own unique history that is worth exploring.\n\nEton College was established by King Henry VI, a devout Catholic, who envisioned a school that would provide education to the sons of the nobility.

This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the period leading up to sleep, when our bodies are preparing for the night ahead. But what drives this emotional intensification, and what are the underlying physiological and psychological factors at play?\n\nOne key factor is the natural fluctuation in our body's cortisol levels throughout the day. Cortisol, often referred to as the \"stress hormone,\" is typically highest in the morning and gradually decreases as the day progresses. However, in the evening, cortisol levels can experience a slight surge, which can lead to increased emotional reactivity. This surge is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation, as our ancestors needed to be more alert and vigilant during the evening hours to protect themselves from potential threats.\n\nAnother significant contributor to evening emotion amplification is the release of melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating our sleep-wake cycles. As melatonin levels rise in the evening, it can have a profound impact on our emotional state. Research suggests that melatonin can increase feelings of relaxation and calmness, but it can also amplify negative emotions, such as anxiety and fear, if we're not pr",

What am I going to do with all this space now? If it wasn't a mansion, would my house have been less expensive?\" During sleep, it is believed that memories formed during the day are being stored away into long term memory. Dreams are believed to be the signals that the brain picks up on and erroneously interprets as perception during this process. It seems as though stressful memories are more likely remembered, so you know how to deal with stress later, and dreams are accidentally a way for you to practice dealing with stress without the risk of failure. Also, scientists performed experiments with people falling asleep hooked up to brain scanners. During early stages of sleep, they were woken up, but they reported that they didn't feel like they even began to fall asleep at all. This suggests that awake/asleep is more like a sliding scale, and we don't always know how conscious we are.

Prior to this discovery, CFCs were widely used as refrigerants, propellants, and solvents due to their non-toxic and non-flammable properties.\n\nThe story began in 1974 when a team of scientists at the University of California, Irvine, led by Dr. Mario Molina and Dr. F.

Their research revealed that CFCs, which were commonly used in aerosol cans, refrigerators, and air conditioners, were not as harmless as previously thought.\n\nMolina and Rowland's study showed that CFCs, when released into the atmosphere, could rise to the stratosphere and break down under the influence of ultraviolet radiation, releasing chlorine atoms.

It makes your debts less valuable, and makes your manufactured goods cheaper for buyers. Now imagine you're in a currency union with a bunch of more economically successful countries and they don't want to devalue the currency. They want the currency strong, and tell you to pound sand.

With major economic and corruption issues, Greece was forced into default on it's loans. Another country may have been able to print more money, causing inflation, but it would have allowed it to pay it's bills at the expense of the buying power of it's citizens.

This gesture has become a staple in countless movies and TV shows, but have you ever wondered why it's done? The answer lies in a mix of historical context, practicality, and cinematic convention.\n\nThe practice of placing a gun and badge on the table during an interrogation scene dates back to the early days of film noir and detective movies. In the 1940s and 1950s, police officers were often portrayed as tough, no-nonsense characters who used their authority to extract confessions from suspects. The gun and badge served as symbols of that authority, conveying the officer's power and intimidation factor.\n\nIn reality, police officers do not typically place their gun and badge on the table during interrogations. In fact, most modern police departments frown upon this practice, as it can be seen as a form of intimidation or coercion. However, in the world of cinema, the gesture has become a shorthand for \"I'm in charge here\" and \"You're not going anywhere.\"\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, placing a gun and badge on the table serves several purposes. It allows the officer to maintain a sense of control and dominance over the situation, while also providing a visual reminder of their authority.

This paradox is rooted in the complex interplay between human perception, air travel, and the laws of physics. In this article, we'll delve into the reasons behind this phenomenon and explore the fascinating science behind it.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that our perception of speed is influenced by a combination of factors, including the speed of the aircraft, the distance traveled, and the duration of the flight. When we're on a plane, we're not just moving at a high speed; we're also experiencing a unique environment that affects our sense of speed. For instance, the constant acceleration and deceleration during takeoff and landing, as well as the gentle rocking motion of turbulence, can make it difficult to gauge our speed.\n\nAnother crucial factor is the concept of \"time dilation.\" As an airplane travels at high speeds, time appears to pass more slowly for passengers compared to those on the ground. This phenomenon, predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, is known as time dilation. While it's a subtle effect, it can contribute to the feeling of slowness. For example, if a plane travels at 600 miles per hour for an hour, the passengers will experience time passing at a slightly slower rate than those on the ground.\n\nThe human b",

            "The Earth is hurtling through the air at many times that speed. We feel acceleration and deceleration, a change in speed, and you definitely feel the acceleration for the first 20 minutes of the flight or so as you take off and ascend. That's why you stay in your seat! Your seat is attached to the plane so it's *pushing* you up to the speed. They get to that speed gradually so it's not too uncomfortable. But once you're at cruising speed and altitude, everything in the plane is moving at the same speed as the plane, so it's like your not moving at all. Speed is relative.",
            "The human body is not great at sensing speed in general, only acceleration. We have a bunch of senses that all work together to let us know when we're changing speed or direction, but we have to rely on context clues to get a sense of constant speed. The next time you're in a car (as a passenger) close your eyes while the driver is going a constant speed on a straight road. You'll notice that it won't feel different from sitting in a parked car. Your sense of speed in a car is largely dependent on seeing objects in the distance and seeing how you move relative to those objects. When you're in a plane, you don't get that kind of feedback. Even with a window seat, objects are so far away that we don't have a good concept of how fast we're traveling. When you're landing and taking off, you start to gain a sense of speed.",

As long as the aircraft maintains a relatively steady speed, there are no forces acting on you that would indicate you are travelling fast. Then looking out the window at altitude, objects on the ground are so distant that you don't have a good reference to know how fast you are travelling. The best time to see how fast you are travelling as at takeoff and landing when you have a better reference as to your speed with objects on the ground.",
            "Because you don't feel velocity. You could be going a million miles an hour and you wouldn't know it. What you feel is acceleration, a change in velocity. On an ordinary plane flight, this occurs at the beginning (during takeoff) and at the end (during landing). You also feel it when the plane changes direction, which also requires a chance in velocity.",
            "Speed doesn't create a force - acceleration creates a force. That's also the reason why you don't feel the force of the earth rotating on its axis, or revolving around the sun at 30 km/second. What creates a force is a *change* in speed, which is what acceleration is. Picture yourself in a stopped car. You're going 0 miles an hour. Do you feel any forces? Not really, you're sitting still, things are good. Now imagine you slam on the gas pedal, going up to 60 mph. Now you feel a *force* because your speed is changing - your body is pressed backwards against the seat by that force. Now you hit 60 and you ease off the gas, maintaining a nice freeway speed. Do you feel any force while you're on the freeway? No, you feel just about the same as you did parked - if you opened a window you could feel the air moving, but inside of your car, everything is just the same as if you were going 0. Except now, slam on the brakes. You're decelerating and changing speed - a force pushes you forward, straining against the seatbelt. Once you hit 0, that force is gone. An airplane works the same way - you accelerate up to 600 mph slowly, so that the force isn't too overwhelming, but once you hit that speed and stop accelerating, it feels just the same as being still on the ground. Aside from any bumps or turbulence, which (just like in a car) change your acceleration by a little bit and affect you as forces.",
            "In an airplane, you don't have much of a frame of reference. The cabin is usually sealed off, so you don't experience the sensation of plane moving through air. Planes try to keep a pretty steady path. Which means you experience few forces due to acceleration once away from the airport. Planes fly pretty high off the ground. If you look out the window, you might be able to make out a few houses or cars at the ground level, moving pretty slowly across your massive plane of view. Their movement means nothing to you, thousands of feet above the ground or any other stationary object."

            "What would happen to the Earth? Probably nothing. If you made an instantaneous hole through the Earth and it wasn't being supported by anything, gravity would cause the solid core to fill the space immediately. The mantle will also fill in immediately. It would be like asking what would happen if you drilled a hole in the ocean. There might be a small earthquake that we can detect but that's about it. I'm not sure what will happen to the crust. Either you would have a very deep hole with a lava plug at the bottom, or a volcano. The earth has thousands of them, and the man made ones will probably be smaller than most, as it won't be over a hot spot or along a plate boundary. It would probably leak lava for a few days or weeks then stop and become extinct. Nothing that would affect very many people. If you could some how shield your hole to keep it form collapsing, nothing would still happen. The hole is too small and earth is too big. Gravity has to do with the mass of the planet, and the mass wouldn't change, or change by much, depending on what you did with the material in the hole, piled it up or simply disappeared it. The magnetic field also wouldn't be affected. Your hole is too small.

            "Simple answer: a perfect and in-destructible hole all the way to the core would start to spew hot liquified material through it. The gravity force on the outer layers would put pressure on the core which would force material through the hole. Edit1: I'm correcting myself based on the comments I have received. Edit1: The material might cool before it reaches the surface. That answer depends on the design of the hole. Edit1: Assuming the material did not solidify, the material would flow until is approximately reaches the surface. Once it gets close to the surface, the weight of the material in the column (hole) would balance out the gravitational pressure. There might be a bit of spew due to the momentum of the material. Since the core is denser than the rest of earth, on average, the material level would settle below earth's average surface. Edit1: I do not know if there is a place on earth where the surface is so far below the average that spewing core-material could happen. I would speculate something in the deepest trenches of the sea but that may not be the \"deepest\" place in this case. Since the earth diameter is smallest pole-to-pole then that might be \"deepest.\" Edit1: ~~Whether the material cools and seals the hole before raining death upon the planet is beyond me but I will speculate:~~ Edit1: ~~I would guess that, since the earth we still exist, then the hole would cool and seal up before raining massive destruction upon us. But...if the hole is insulated then there might be unimpeded flow to the surface.~~ Even if there is unimpeded flow to the surface, the next question would be whether the cooling at the surface caps the flow. ~~Again, since we still exist,~~ Since we still exist, the most likely answer is that the surface cooling would abate the flow.",

Second, such a hole, made the way you describe, would in effect be a continuing part of the surface (mathematically speaking), since you can't admit any part of the interior without destroying the hole. You would indeed require extremely strong tools and materials, greatly exceeding the capabilities of anything we have. If that was possible, and you were able to make the hole, then the hole would, for practical purposes, not be a hole into the earth, but a tunnel from one side to the other, around which the interior would flow (and not likely notice it, due to the enormity of comparative scale).

            "I have read a couple of books that had this scenario. It really depends on what kind of hole you're talking about. But here's the one I really remember: If you had a 3-foot diameter hole that went from one side of the earth, straight through the center to the other side, with an impervious material lining the walls of that hole, not much of anything would happen. if you then vacuum-sealed that hole, and put a near-frictionless car and rail system inside, you would have an extremely low-energy transport from one side of the earth to the other. It would be quite a fast trip, starting with the approximately 32.2 feet per second per second \"free fall\" acceleration, and gradually decreasing to the center, then gradually increasing to bring you to a cushy, 1g stop on the other side of the planet. This is entirely hypothetical, and completely undoable with today's technology. However, a hole that size through the center of the Earth would have negligible effect on anything else on the planet. Like sticking a hypodermic needle through the center of a grapefruit.",

Digging through the core would no doubt disrupt this motion, and weaken if not destroy our magnetic field. No magnetic field means almost certain extinction of life on Earth. Bummer. Assuming our magnetic field was left intact, the question of where the material from the hole would end up arises. Wherever it was, a lot of the Earth's mass would now be there, which might skew the Earth's gravitational pull. I'm not an expert so I'm probably wrong. I'd love to hear an answer from someone who knows what they're talking about though. Very interesting question indeed.",

            "I'm actually having a lot of fun with this, so I think this warrants a direct reply. First issue I see is that the cylinder would need to be filled with air. Some have suggested this would cause weather disturbances, and it might. I don't think it'd be big though. Assuming a 1m cylinder, the total volume would be about 0.08km3. That's pretty small, in terms of atmosphere. 1.0x10-9 % of the atmosphere. I'm not a meteorologist, but i don't think that'd cause anything other than a stiff wind for a while. This assumes a constant pressure, which is, of course, not realistic. The pressure is actually a bit of a monster. For curiosities sake, I'm playing with it. If you just do a straight exponential calculation, assuming the mechanics all the way down are the same as on the surface, you'd get 2.145x1013 kPa. That's 20 000 000 000 the surface pressure, and more than enough to create what's called a supercritical fluid. At those pressures, the gases would actually \"condense\", but not in the conventional sense. It's a very strange state of matter that's tough to ELI5. However, this is not the case. Earth is not a point mass, and the gravitational force pulling on the air column would not be constant. So I'll fiddle with the calculus a bit more for fun, and let you know what it comes out to. [EDIT: I worked it out as far as I could, but apparently I broke WolframAlpha trying to solve it. So we may be out of luck here.] As for the magnetic field, I did't read anything that'd say it would be an immediate issue. Our magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core, which is driven by tidal forces caused by the Sun. A 1m radius tube would likely not cause a significant disruption here. The core is a problem though. The dynamics of the inner core are not well know, but most geologists agree that it's a solid (some imply a highly compressed liquid that acts solid, and a few other theories, but solid core seems to dominate). So we've just drilled a hole through a solid core. A core that has a faster angular rotation than the surface. So one of two things would happen: either the core would continue to rotate, and we would lose the tube pretty quick, or the core would stop relative to the surface. Not imagine how much angular energy is stored in a rotating, massive, sphere of highly dense nickel-iron alloy. That would all need to go somewhere.I don't know exactly how it'd be dispersed, but it would be like trying to stop a huge flywheel, and the results would likely be catastrophic. Extinction event catastrophic. The last issue, all the rest aside, comes down to temperature and radiation. The Earth's core is in the ballpark of 4 000K (about 4 300C, or 7 800F). There is no known substance that could shield from that heat, or any cooling method to avoid melting/combusting pretty much anything thrown in. Then there's the radiation. I couldn't find any exact numbers on concentration, so it's tough to find an exact dose. However, the Earth as a whole is estimated to produce 20TW of radioactive energy. So I'll go out on a limb and guess that the level would be past the lethal dose for a person, and probably irradiate any inorganic object going through. Let's assume that all this is a non-issue, for fun. Just to examine the timeline of jumping in. Since we are ignoring the fatal pressures, temperatures, and the like, let's just assume a complete vacuum. The number most people use to traverse the diameter of the planet is about 42 minutes, which isn't too bad (This number would not be affected by equatorial bulge, and would not have any significant difference due to elevation changes. Height is not a variable in a perfect pendulum). You'd hit about 11 000m/s at the core, assuming constant acceleration (some people are saying 8 000m/s. Not the number I got, but either way, it's crazy fast). Now, as you probably know, a perfect pendulum will reach exactly the same height at which it was dropped. Same for you. The elevation variations in the Earth's surface vary by about 0.22%. Not enough to make a significant difference in travel time, but definitely enough to make an impact on your arrival. So you'd likely fall short and oscillate infinitely. If there was any source of energy loss, you'd eventually settle at the core, experiencing zero G. Doesn't sound fun to me. However, you would also have angular velocity. Since the radius of rotation decreases with the descent, your relative lateral velocity would increase, and you'd end up riding the side of the tube all the way down, like a slide. Even though it's straight down, you'd fall kind of like it's angled. By the time you hit the core, all of the lateral energy would be gone. As you ascended, you'd now have *less* angular velocity than the tube, and slide all the way back up. Obviously, all this friction is a huge problem, and would pretty much destroy any hope you had of reaching the other side, unless we extended the hypothetical to include a frictionless tube. TL;DR This would be a very bad thing. You'd either destroy the planet, waste a lot of resources for something that wouldn't last, or inevitably become stuck in the core of the Earth forever. So let's not build this, okay? EDIT: Please feel free to review my statements. What I've found is hardly the gospel truth. Some of the theories I referenced are not completely accepted, some of my math may be off, and some is wild speculation. I mostly did this because I answered a few points, started digging, and then this behemoth formed. Also, apologies for it not all being completely ELI5, or for what likely may be a few spelling/grammar errors. This was just done on the fly between classes.",

        "context": "The Sensory Experience of Smell: A Comparative Analysis\n\nSmell is a fundamental sense that plays a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing our emotions, memories, and behaviors. For humans, the sensory experience of smell is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is shaped by our brain's ability to process and interpret chemical signals. But how does it compare to the experience of other animals?\n\nFrom a biological perspective, the sense of smell is a universal trait among animals, with most species possessing a unique olfactory system. In humans, the olfactory system is responsible for detecting odor molecules in the air, which are then transmitted to the brain for processing. This process involves the binding of odor molecules to specialized receptors on the surface of olfactory sensory neurons, triggering a cascade of electrical signals that ultimately give rise to our perception of smell.\n\nCompared to other animals, the human sense of smell is relatively limited. While we can detect a wide range of odors, our olfactory system is not as sensitive as that of many other species. For example, dogs have up to 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to only 6 million in humans. This is why dogs are often used in search and rescue missions, as their keen sense of smell allows them to detect subtle scents that are undetectable to humans.\n\nIn contrast, some animals have a highly developed sense of smell that is essential for their survival. For example, many insects, su",

            "I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind. Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound. I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles. Maybe you can get a general feel for what people are saying by watching lips (so long as they face you), but you miss out on the effects of the background music for setting mood and all the foley effects.

            "Many of the responses here deal with the emotional response that smelling something produces. I think that's good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there's still a link in the chain there that's missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I'm sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn't explaining anything that you don't already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that's just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I'm a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I'm keenly aware of them and they can't be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can't ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That's generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren't overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you're just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don't linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after.",

            "I read an article about a woman who had a magnet in planted in her finger. This resulted in a new sense where she could feel magnetic flieds (like microwave ovens, high voltage lines, etc.) and detect near by metal. Thinking about this completely alien sense helped me to consider my other senses more objectively. So being able to smell actually gives you information about the chemistry of objects. Consider all the chemical reactions that take place in cooking; they result in differnt smells (and tastes). Smell can also tell you if fruit and vegiyables are ripe or even spoiled. Likewise of meat goes bad it give off a smell - kind of a warning. So you can think of that as being smiliar to being able to see or hear that information - since you get it from a distance. It it probably more similar to hearing since it doesn't require direct or uninterrupted \"line - of - sight\". Off all my senses, smell is the one that most often conveys bad information. For like in the case of spoilage, the smell is revolting. Like a loud sound, or a bright light. Smell is a really strong trigger for memories too. For many people smelling cookies reminds them of home. Or maybe certain foods remind them of holidays. The part of the brain that processes olfactory (smell) information is closely associated with memories. Because smell gets stronger the closer you get to the subject, it often times draws me in for smells I like (good food, a woman with nice colonge, the smell of the woods, etc.), or drives me away for ones I dislike (spoilage, feeces, filth, body oder, too much fragrance, etc). As a parent of small children, smell is one way I know my kids needs a clean diaper. Often times he\\she will get cranky (audible) or show other visual signs. The smell is another queue. My mother in law has no sense of smell, so she would always stick a finger in the diaper to veifiy - which is messy. I just look when I am unsure. Generally speaking smell is a way we learn things not to eat. There are some poisons that are adapted to smell good or not at all, but very few things that smell bad that are good for you (individual tastes aside). So smell is just another way to collect information at a distance from the world around us. Most of that information can be collected other ways too.

You feel your body open up to pull it in, your eyes close and you salivate involuntarily, and everything around you slows just a little bit. Think of it a little like being in the afterglow of a good orgasm. Conversely, a bad smell is not as often tied with memory but creates a very physical response just the same. You'll feel your throat close as you gag, and your stomach churn or heave. The smell feels viscous and heavy in your mouth, as though it's tangible and you've bitten down on it.

The brothers have a bet with each other, with Randolph wagering that they can make a fortune by manipulating the price of orange juice and Mortimer betting that they cannot.\n\nThe scheme at the end of the film involves Louis and Billy Ray, who have been pawns in the Duke Brothers' game, turning the tables on them. Louis, who has been framed and fired from his job, and Billy Ray, who has been hired by the Duke Brothers to replace Louis, concoct a plan to buy a large quantity of orange juice at the high price set by the Duke Brothers. This would seem like a foolish move, as they would be buying the juice at a high price, but it's actually a clever tactic.\n\nBy buying the orange juice at the high price, Louis and Billy Ray are essentially fo",

            "The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit.",

Also if they deposit the cash from everyone's savings lets say 100k and the margin per contract is 5k per contract they can only buy or sell 20 contracts.

In reality I think it would've been the firm that they trade through and that provided them the loan in the first place.

These channels were known for their in-depth documentaries on various subjects, including history, science, and culture. However, over the past two decades, these channels have undergone a significant transformation, shifting their focus from traditional documentaries to reality TV.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this shift is the changing viewing habits of audiences. With the rise of cable television and the proliferation of channels, viewers have become accustomed to a 24-hour diet of entertainment programming. Reality TV, with its fast-paced, engaging, and often sensational content, has become a staple of modern television. Documentary channels, which were once the go-to destination for educational programming, have struggled to compete with the attention-grabbing nature of reality TV.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the shift is the increasing cost of producing high-quality documentaries. Documentaries often require significant resources, including funding, equipment, and personnel. In contrast, reality TV shows are often cheaper to produce, as they rely on existing footage and don't require the same level of expertise as documentaries. This cost-effectiveness has made reality TV a more attractive option for documentary channels lookin",

            "Alright, sit yo ass down and get ready for a story. The TLDR is indeed ratings and production cost. But if that's the why, we must ask ourselves \"why now?\" What happened to these stations, and why did it all happen at the same time? Well, the seed of change (or pestilence if you wanna be poetic) is TLC. Before The Channel Formally known as Learning gave us child beauty pageants and whatever the fuck Honey Boo Boo is supposed to be. You see, in 2007 Discovery was kind of in a hole. As you may know Discovery owns, TLC, Nat Geo, Animal Planet and more. Despite their wide net, the brand was tanking. So they brought in a man from NBC (who would soon sell out to Comcast) to liven things up. The Discovery Channel store was closed, the main station started doing documentaries more fit for history channel with \"True crime\" exploitation pieces. This would in turn hemorrhage viewership from History (A sister network of A & E) who began showing programs like Gangland. Modern Marvels (which had existed since 1995) got a shiny update, and the content of the History Channel become the closest content rival for Discovery. But then, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, or more accurately here comes TLC's shit shows. Ya see, part of the way Discovery was able to have so many networks was appealing to different demos for each one. History had been nailing the males over 40 crowd and discovery had been shooting for educated younger males. TLC was basically discovery channel marketed to women in their early 20s to early 30s, and you know what bored women of that age-range were watching? Soaps, MTV/VH1 reality shows and celebrity gossip. Taking a \"documentary\" series about child fashion shows and editing it like an MTV reality show with a healthy bit of exploitation (the fans of these shows are watching to laugh at these people, make no mistake) and they suddenly had a the right ingredients for what would become a network of cheep, exploitative, schlock across all Discovery Networks (well, except the Science Channel). So What really happened? What really changed? Demographics. Say what you will about these networks being crap, they do a good job of not internally fighting with each other for attention. The Honey Boo Boo crowd doesn't want much to do with \"are Megladon's still around\" the age range, income level, and general education of the demo they're trying to reach can be reliably expected to enjoy the TV click bait. They figured out something Buzzfeed did before you wanted to inexplicably punch it in the face: people don't want to learn, they want to have what they know and like confirmed. This is how Discovery Channels' most profitable stretch, year after year, is telling people sharks aren't violent murder machines (except when they are but it's okay because not to people) like it's the first time anybody has heard this information. Apologies to Shark Week fans, but how surreal is it that the most educational thing on the network is telling a demographic that didn't grow up with Jaws shit they already know from last year? And then there's history channel. History is, again, owned by A & E not discovery. History is a tougher nut to dissect. In short, as they became more direct competition for Discovery they began duplicating what was making discovery successful. Deadliest Catch became Ice Road Truckers, bad speculative science docs became Ancient Aliens. History duplicated the pacing of TLC and marketed it to men, but dumbed its content down to turn the stuff with potential to be good into a filter for Discovery Channel's scraps. A & E went the way of TLC and now theirs no real market incentive to change. If you really want to know whose to blame, look in the mirror. The original demographics have moved on. We're watching Netflix and are simply too educated to watch a show about convergent mermaid evolution. Discovery says they're gonna start making quality programming again, so demand might be returning as Millennials get more disposable income (Oh right, the other big reason! Because of the whole recession thing, cheaper shows became a must and Gen-Xers aged 34-48 had more money than the groups they were, on paper, marketing towards so include this disclaimer in the paragraph about TLC's market shift) and educated young people starting families in their late 20s is presenting itself as a important demographic to snag. In short: The Economy tanked around the same time as the networks underwent massive internal restructuring. Networks that were in mild competition with each other entered a full race to the bottom and neither one went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.",

However, the status of illegal immigrants in the country raises questions about their ability to exercise this fundamental right. Do they have a constitutional right to bear arms, and if so, what are the legal implications and potential limitations?\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe Second Amendment was ratified in 1791, and its original intent was to ensure the ability of citizens to defend themselves and their communities. Over time, the Supreme Court has interpreted the amendment to apply to all law-abiding citizens, regardless of their immigration status. In the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\n\nLegal Implications\n\nWhile the Second Amendment does not explicitly mention immigration status, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right that applies to all citizens. In the case of United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause extends the Second Amendment's protections to all citizens, regardless of their race or national origin.\n\nHowever, the legal landscape is more complex when it come",

If it says person, then any human within the jurisdiction of the US has that right whether here legally or not. So, like the 5th and 14th amendments specify person, so they apply.",
            "There is a gigantic misconception among people that the Constitution gives us civil rights. As the Declaration of Independence says:  > We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In other words:  > It is obvious to all of us that every human being is born equal, and that all of us are born with certain fundamental rights that cannot be taken away; some, but certainly not all, of these rights are the right to be alive, the right to be free, and the right to choose how to live your life. The Constitution does not give us our human rights -- they're granted to us upon birth by God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever you believe to be the source of fundamental truth. Everyone has these rights. American or foreign, bad people, good people, your worst enemy. Saints, criminals, murderers -- everyone is born with fundamental rights and they *cannot be taken away* by human beings, because who are we to remove a gift bestowed by God? Because these rights are inherent, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights don't provide them; rather, the documents provide *prohibitions on the government* from infringing on the exercise of these fundamental rights we are all born with. The Founders believed that the best government would be one that honored and protected its citizens natural rights. Now, some infringement of our rights is necessary to provide for social welfare and order, but even here, it's more about balancing the exercise of our rights; e.g., when you deny a criminal his right to freedom in order to protect other people's right to live free of physical harm. These rights are distinct in the Constitution from the Privileges  &  Immunities of citizenship, which *are* the things that we are granted as Americans. These include things like the entitlement to vote, to travel freely between states, and to have free access to commercial markets. These privileges *are* granted by the government and *can* be taken away. The Constitution recognizes the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. So, yes, illegal immigrants have that fundamental right -- they were born with it, just as you are. However, as I said, the Founders and the Constitution recognize that complete anarchy leads to greater infringement on human rights (because the strongest just takes over as tyrant), so the government is allowed enact reasonable regulations that infringe on fundamental rights to the extent that they are necessary to protect social order and welfare. One of the infringements that's reasonable is prohibiting noncitizens from owning firearms -- it is reasonable for a nation to protect itself by preventing armed foreigners from roaming free within its borders.",
            "While many whip themselves into a lather, over the mistaken notion that illegal aliens are essentially given all the same rights and privileges as citizens, under our Constitution, it is important to point out that their guaranteed rights are not exactly the same as citizenship: Their protections stem from Section One, of the Fourteenth Amendment: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive **any person** of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to **any person within its jurisdiction** the equal protection of the laws.\"",
            "To buy a gun legally from an authorized FFL, you need to either be a citizen or have a green card. So, no, you don't have second amendment rights as an illegal.",
            "There are numerous laws which prohibit the possession of a firearm while in the commission of a crime. Illegal aliens by their very act of being here are committing an ongoing crime every second they're in the US without permission, hence being in the United States illegally and possessing a firearm is illegal.",
            "This is a case where there are some mixed decisions from federal courts. Some courts have found that illegal immigrants do have a right to bear arms, but many have not. The 7th Circuit, for example, found in 2015 that they do have a right to bear arms, but that a federal law prohibiting them from possessing firearms was somehow valid. Don't ask me how they figured that one. The 4th, 5th, and 8th Circuits have ruled that they do not have that right. What does that mean? It means this is a case that will likely be resolved eventually by the US Supreme Court."

Look at at writing or at a clock. Note what the writing says or what time it is. Look away. Look back. If the writing is different, or the time is more than a few seconds off, you're dreaming. 2. Trace your steps back as far as you can. In a dream – even an extremely vivid, lucid one – you get stuck at some point and can't remember anything before that. While awake, you can trace your whole day back to when you woke up in your bed, then the day before, then the week before, etc. 3. Ask yourself if you're in a dream. Concentrate on your surroundings. Even if you're in a familiar place, is it how you remember it being? Are the physics around you the same? What about the behavior of those around you? 4. Hold your breath for as long as you can. If you can go on without feeling the urgent demand for air, you're dreaming. If you *are* dreaming and realize it, then you are in a [lucid dream]( URL_0 )! Go nuts, have fun, do whatever you want! In a lucid dream, you are experiencing a world your own mind has constructed. All you need in order to know if you are dreaming or not is to witness something that you know is impossible. One of the easiest ones is looking at your hands and pressing your fingers into the palm of the other hand and (in your mind) ordering them to go through. Obviously, this is impossible in reality, but you should be able to do it in a dream.",

In dreams, the lack of underlying reality will eventually show through, because no dream is perfect.

In reality, I can choose not to do something and not do it. It's sort of like hallucinations. I see and hear things all the time. If people are handy, I watch them before reacting. If they don't, I assume that whatever it is, it's solely my experience. I hope this helps.",

But who was the first winner of this beloved competition? Let's take a step back in time to relive the inaugural season of America's Got Talent.\n\nThe first season of America's Got Talent premiered on June 21, 2006, on NBC. The show was created by Simon Cowell, who had previously found success with the British version of the show, Britain's Got Talent. The competition featured a diverse range of acts, including singers, dancers, magicians, and comedians. The judges' panel consisted of Cowell, Brandy Norwood, and David Hasselhoff.\n\nThe competition was fierce, with 100 acts vying for the top spot. However, in the end, it was 10-year-old singer-songwriter Bianca Ryan who stole the hearts of the judges and the audience. Ryan's powerful vocals and charming stage presence earned her a spot in the finale, where she faced off against 12-year-old magician Tanya Lee.\n\nOn August 17, 2006, the results were announced, and Bianca Ryan was crowned the first winner of America's Got Talent.

            "A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, it's certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google \"Xenu\" or \"Thetans\". There's a fairly recent book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it's gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you. But with so much social media these days I think they've had a hard time applying pressure on-line like they used to. **TL;DR** - It's mostly crazy bullshit, but *profitable* crazy bullshit.",
            "Well, not to speak on the actual religion's dogma (as most religions when examined are usually odd beliefs), the reason for controversy is the level of control they try to exert over their members, ex-members, and anybody who tries to criticize them. The means by which they have done this at times have been considered at a minimum, highly unethical or moral, or just plain illegal. They have been accused of fostering a \"cult-like\" mentality among their members.",

            "For much of the postwar 20th century, if you were a young white man with at least a high-school education, you had to try *not* to get a job that would fund at least a lower-middle-class lifestyle. If you had a college degree in *anything*, even English or Art History, you were pretty much guaranteed a lifetime of desk jobs, each higher-paying and more powerful than the last, with The Firm, which would then take care of you through retirement with a pension. If you came into The Firm with a Bachelors, it might actually pay your time *and your tuition* for a Masters. When you went home at the end of the night, work was generally over - there was no email. Calling someone at home was a big deal and used mostly for emergencies. (This era is largely where the perception that the unemployed are just lazy comes from. There really was a time when you had to be lazy to be unemployed.) Nowadays, you need to get into a good elementary school that will prepare you to work hard in middle school so you can take the right classes in high school to get into a good college in a handful of the \"right\" majors, and then maybe go to graduate school, to stand a *chance* of getting a good job if you're also a friendly/interesting person who interviews well. Outside a handful of labor markets, your health insurance and retirement plans will be token benefits (if they exist at all). You'll need to hit the streets, blast your resume around, write a ton of cover letters, and practice your interview game so you can change jobs every few years to increase your salary with your experience. Employers certainly aren't handing out meaningful raises just for showing up. Your bosses may expect you to answer your cell phone or respond to texts/emails promptly late into the night. For blue-collar workers, much of this can be attributed to globalization and automation. For white-collar workers... as just one example, many corporations needed what was basically database functionality long before databases existed.

You can have a \"corporate culture\" of \"passionate\" people who work 10 more hours a week for the same salary and hire 20% fewer of them.

            "In the US young people have the problem of a changing nature of labor and the contract between worker and corporation. In past few decades wages have not increased with respect to ~interest rates~ inflation, in many ways they have decreased. This means we get a larger number in terms of dollars from the companies we work for, but we receive far less value for our work. So we have to work more. We work for smaller firms generally, shops and retail, tinier operations that make unionizing and collective bargaining less viable strategies for supporting our labor's value. A major reason for the existence of unions was to combat the spreading de-humanization of work, which simply put took satisfaction out of labor and alienated people. Additionally, they helped support labor in national politics. By and large people born in the past 20 years will never join or support a union, and won't be able to offer each other support for their livelihoods. This means goods are slightly cheaper, but labor is cheaper still, so we have to work more to stay solvent. Gains in women's rights and expanded diversity have slightly offset the effects of wage stagnation, but the crisis of 2008 shows us that we won't get back to the state of the mid-90s labor. The minimum wages your parents worked for briefly as youths are the wages you will work for until you are middle-aged, when you briefly make more and then get fired and have to work for minimum wages again (on average). In the past century our labor has become a substantial portion of our identities. If you write a story about someone, the thing they spend time doing to make money is probably the first thing you use to describe them. This is Jim, an accountant, or Mary, an engineer, or Sanjeet, a flight attendant, etc. Well, now your profession will last 15 months, on average. You will change jobs many times in your lifetime as a replaceable cog in a variety of machines that don't care about you. Oh, and you won't be able to retire on the average person's wages. You'll get no pension, and once you are fired for being less productive than a computer the company you worked for will forget you ever existed. All your work will have your name scrubbed from it and your impact on the world will be indistinguishable from the person in the cubical next to yours (on average). edit: Thank you DrunkHacker.",

            "When we talk about that we're talking about the post war generations. A few things happened in America that was completely unprecedented. One, most the the industrialized world was in ruin except for the United States, this led to a large number of high paying private manufacturing jobs. Two the United States vs. the Soviet Union made it necessary for large government expenditure and expansion, this also created jobs. Three, women retreated from the work force after the war creating more demand for labor. These three things made it extremely easy to find good paying work. Now, lets look at housing. Housing cost from post war until about 1975 rose, roughly, with inflation. In the mid 70s the price of housing started to outpace inflation, this has accelerated so that a house in 1970 that would have cost 100k(adjusted for inflation) would have cost 200k in 1990, and today that exact same house would run half a million. These are national numbers, there are certainly places in America where this isn't the case, but it's true in most places. Next is education. I'll keep this one easy. In 1960 it cost roughly $9500 in inflation adjusted dollars to attend an ivy league school. It now costs over $40,000.

Located in the county of Fillmore, a 202-pound slab of greywacke, an ancient type of sedimentary rock, bears an intriguing inscription in the form of runes. This enigmatic artifact has sparked a flurry of curiosity, prompting us to delve into its history, significance, and the mysteries surrounding its origins.\n\n**The Discovery**\n\nThe slab, measuring approximately 3 feet by 2 feet, was unearthed in 1938 during a routine excavation at the Fillmore County Historical Society's museum. Initially, the significance of the find was unclear, but as experts began to examine the inscription, they realized that it was a rare and valuable discovery.\n\n**The Runes**\n\nThe inscription on the slab consists of a series of runes, an ancient writing system used by the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe. The runes are believed to date back to the 5th or 6th century, a period of significant cultural and linguistic change in the region. The meaning of the inscription remains a topic of debate among scholars, with some interpreting it as a message of protection or a magical incantation.\n\n**Historical Context**\n\nThe discovery of the greywacke slab provides a unique window into the lives of the ancient inhabitants of Minnesota.

Komen for the Cure isn't doing much to fight breast cancer *financially* -- don't donate to them! But they have been effective in raising awareness, which is good in general. A good awareness campaign was the ALS ice bucket challenge. You didn't need to pay anyone to do it (other than ice and bucket providers, I guess) and you would donate directly to research instead of to professional awareness campaign managers like Komen. But if you ever see some company spending vast amounts of resources for a charitable cause with no obvious source of funding, you should be asking yourself where the company gets the money, and more often than not, it's enriching itself under the guise of \"awareness\" (which, again, is a worthwhile thing to have).",

And has the most successful marketing plan, think about it, how many \"specific cancer\" months can you name most of the big ones have a month but none with the prevalence of breast cancer. Women in the USA make far more purchasing decisions than Men so it is not a stretch to think that buying power hasn't reached to charitable endeavors as well. So breast cancer has high visibility, and I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, just that it, is, a thing. The fact of the matter is that raising breast cancer awareness can be an effective vehicle for general awareness of all cancers.

            "I'll say something other than the conspiracies (however much truth there may be) here. Awareness is so much more than making someone aware of beat cancers mere existence. Awareness is about knowing and recognizing the signs in yourself and others, so that the disease can be detected early, and thus be more easily treated. For example, I bet most people who have heard of breast cancer haven't heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It's a rare form of breast cancer that forms in sheets instead of lumps. By the time it's detectable as a misshapen breast, is usually already at stage 4. Another example is that men can and do get breast cancer. Most men don't realize this, and would have absolutely no idea how to monitor for it. That's another part of awareness: knowing who is at risk. Most people only know that lumps = breast cancer. But there are many kinds that manifest in different ways. Awareness helps (or should) people understand more about the disease, not just make them aware that it exists. This should be the case for most cancers, but breast cancer gained traction due to its prevalence in modern America, and organizations like SGK getting the word out. P.S. Try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when talking about breast cancer awareness. There are shady people trying to profit off it, sure, but there are also a lot of people out there who this cause is very important to, and are trying to help with nothing but the best intentions. My sisters and I are considering starting a charity for IBC awareness and research, in honor of our mother who died from it. We've already hosted a few fundraisers whose proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. There are people out there trying to help. I'm one of them.

            "There are a lot of highly voted aggressive neckbeard comments. While they we not entirely incorrect in facts, they are false in the response to the question. The main reason is awareness and clarity. People don't get checked. They get cancer and then it's too late. If you get frequent checks you might prevent cancer or find it at a point that it can be removed. Terminal cancer is often found too late and could have been prevented. Since the awareness month and company campaigns, breast cancer deaths HAVE went down, and prevention has went up. That result is good and has saved the life's of your mothers, sisters, and wife's. So what if komen pays its ceo 85% of all the earnings. Some companies focus on awareness and the promotion of the message instead of actual research and that does result in life's saved. All it takes is that pink shirt or commercial to get that stubborn woman to get a check. Plenty of other companies over pay their CEOs and higher up while doing nothing for the community and saving no life's. Look at the positives, and if you know the facts, donate to different charities like the research programs themselfs but don't ask for the abolishment or harass the ones like komen, because without them we have a lot less awareness and advertisement. You can have the best researchers with the most funding on the world but without awareness they have no one to cure.",

They do fund some things like mammos for poor women but the amount of money spent by people buying pink stuff is way more than is spent on research.

            "There was a time when people with certain diseases were seen as weak, or generally lesser people. A lot of the awareness stuff just kind of normalizes this.

We should not forget about them, and we should not look down on them either.",
            "Seems like there are many cynics out here. It's true there are many parasitic organizations that capitalize on our charity and good will, but the fact is that breast cancer is one of the many cancers where death is preventable if caught in early stages. This is alongside cervical (get your pap smears at 21 ladies, and HPV vaccines for everyone), prostate for men (older men should do digital rectal exams), and of course lung (stop smoking). It's a little unfair to say that breast cancer is the only one getting awareness when all these other cancers are also getting attention. I think breast cancer was the first big movement because you are able to do a self-exam and that is empowering to women, so it is now the biggest (btw the main reliable screening tool is regular mammographies, so self-exams are a start, but not sufficient). Just to provide a scale of the problem, more than 50% (a half!) of women will develop a benign breast lesion. Fortunately most of these are not lethal and should not progress to a malignancy. More than 10% of women will develop a true malignancy, where your odds of survival are almost exponential the earlier you catch it. So it's kind of important to make it common knowledge how to find a lump in your breast, because there's a chance that it might kill you. That's not to deny the aforementioned parasitic organizations. I guess the best advice is find a good charity of your choice and ignore the bad ones, but don't hate on the movement as a whole because it is trying to make a difference for the American public.",

But now what do you do with the organization they built up? For something like breast cancer awareness, their mission is complete. The public at large knows about it, and pays attention to the changing recommendations about it. But are they going to just tell their staff \"Alright everybody, we won! Show's over, you're all fired.\" Of course not - The people working here will \"Goal creep\" and look for new things to do to legitimize their organization.

Most of it goes to advertising and the millions of dollars worth of salaries for the higher-ups. There was an infograph I saw on ifuckinglovescience about a year ago that showed the deadliest diseases versus how much funding they received.

As you might be aware, most non-profit organizations have to divide their resources between administration and their cause. What you might not be aware of is that a lot of the administrative costs go toward finding more funding. Unless a non-profit has a stable stream of income from committed donors, grants, or an endowment, every non-profit is in constant pursuit of more sources of revenue. This often means hiring a professional grant writer and hosting some sort of open house or gala that informs and solicits donors. Even stable non-profits will probably be constantly pursuing more revenue to further their cause and expand their programs. The Komen Foundation decided to try a for-profit marketing campaign in order to get revenue. The people they hired advised them to have an ambitious advertising campaign with the justification that it would bring in a lot more revenue than it cost. It cost a ton of money but it was wildly successful, so they have kept it up and followed those strategies. The obvious downside is that an inappropriately large percentage of their budget goes toward marketing, which increases awareness but does not create a cure.

            "This is a two-fold answer for me. 1: 'Awareness' is a euphemism for money. Ideally research money, but people make a profit on the research as well. When you say you are raising money, it puts people off. When you say you are raising awareness, people are more likely to be involved because their is not cost. 2: Saying you are raising awareness allows people who make no physical contribution to feel like they are doing something important, when all they are doing is sharing something on social media. They are \"raising awareness\" and pat themselves on the back, when really they are just being arm-chair activists. That is not a bad thing. You can't make concrete contributions to every cause, so promoting others is good, but too often I think people believe if they click 'like', they are doing something other than easing their conscience.",

Like when adverts remind us to fill in tax returns, we all know about it but can easily ignore it. So being reminded will keep it in out minds to do it sooner. It also helps make it less scary for some people, knowing that their not alone and others that may not be in their situation can talk knowledgeably or aid helpfully.

There are many types of cancer that affect both sexes that are more prevalent and deadlier than breast cancer but it's a way for people to show support for womens causes and so it gets a lot of attention. Prostate cancer is just as deadly and many men die from it each year yet very little is done about it from a fundraising perspective. This can be argued because it's a cancer that affects privileged men VS under privileged women. Supporting womens causes is seen as progressive. Supporting mens causes or equal right causes is seen as misogynistic to some. To put it another way, all the hype around breast cancer awareness is just a kind of reverse sexism.",

        "context": "The Expiration Date Conundrum: Does Baking with Expired Milk Affect its Shelf Life?\n\nWhen it comes to baking, the quality of ingredients can make all the difference in the final product. One common concern among bakers is the expiration date of milk, particularly when it's used in a recipe. Does baking with milk that's expiring tomorrow mean the cake will also expire tomorrow? Or does the baking process somehow nullify the milk's expiration date? Let's dive into the world of food science to find out.\n\nHistorical Context:\nThe concept of expiration dates originated in the early 20th century as a way to ensure food safety. The idea was to provide consumers with a clear indication of when a product was no longer safe to consume. Milk, being a dairy product, is particularly susceptible to spoilage due to its high water content and delicate nutritional profile.\n\nNotable Insights:\nWhen milk expires, it doesn't necessarily mean it's spoiled or unsafe to consume. Instead, it's a warning that the milk's quality and nutritional value may start to degrade. This degradation can occur due to various factors, such as bacterial growth, oxidation, or enzymatic reactions.\n\nNow, when it comes to baking with expired milk, the answer lies in the baking process itself. When you mix milk with other ingredients and heat it, the milk's chemical composition undergoes significant changes. The heat and moisture from the baking process can:\n\n1. Denature proteins: Heat can alter the structure of milk prot",

            "The expiration date from the milk is no longer relevant. Your cake will have the same shelf regardless of whether you used milk expiring tomorrow, or milk expiring much later, because you have killed all the bacteria that were going to make the milk spoil.",
            "I worked at a food production facility and it's cool how much effort went into knowing the answers to this type of question. Every ingredient in a product that ends up for sale is considered and chosen for that recipe based on freshness dates. If certain ingredients are not as fresh then the 'sell by' date is changed. Potato salad with all fresh ingredients gets, say, three days on the shelf before the mayo goes off. That's basically universal, so extended shelf life means added salts, maybe sugar or vinegar but usually salt. So if your local deli has takeout potato salad and they say it's good for 2 days refrigerated and Wal-Mart has a tub of it but it's good for 6 days and we can assume similar ingredients ( they don't have magic mayo ) then it's a guarantee the extra 4 days come from the massive amount of added salt.",
            "There are a few different dates that get put on food, and they have different meanings. **Sell by** - mostly meaningless to consumers. A note for the store to discard the food after this date, but it's often a week or more before the food goes bad. Ignore this date, or add a week to it. Your milk probably has this date on it. **Best before** - a note for the customer. Quality can't be 100% guaranteed after this date, so you can't sue if it's not up to par, but it's still edible. **Use by** - this is a real one, but it only means quality may degrade after this date. If it smells okay, it's likely still safe. However, all of the above applies to ***unopened*** food. Once you open it, you introduce bacteria and humidity, and if you don't store it properly the date on the package doesn't matter. There are different ways food goes \"bad\" once it's opened: - **Stale/dry:** The flavor or texture is changed by the air. It doesn't taste the best, but it's not bad for you. - **Rancid:** Oils go bad. Some oils are prone to going bad from oxygen, heat, and light. Not only do they taste and smell bad, but they can chemically harm your body. - **Contaminated:** Bacteria grow when there's water or moisture. The bacteria can make you sick, and many bacteria (like botulism) make toxic wastes. Cooking it well kills the bacteria, but cooking won't get rid of the toxins. - **Moldy:** Fungus grows when there's moisture. If you see fuzzy mold or weird colors *anywhere* on the food, it's everywhere in the food. Throw it out. Now, back to the milk. The date on the carton is likely the \"sell by\" date, not an expiration date. Once it's home, add a week to get a better expiry date. Regardless of the date, if you haven't opened it yet, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. If you opened it in the past week and kept it in the fridge, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. It's been in the fridge open for more than a week... bacteria may have gotten in. Pour a bit into a cup and give it a smell. Your nose is good at detecting when something is off. **If it smells ok, it's probably good to cook with.** Cooking will kill off any bacteria and reset the expiration date. Cooking will likely fix stale or dry food too. You can put stale tortilla chips in the oven and they'll be good as new. You can cook with milk beyond its date if it smells fine. **If it looks or smells weird or gross, don't cook with it.** Cooking can kill bacteria, but it can't get rid of the toxic wastes from the bacteria or fungus, and it can't fix any rancid oils. However, you should know that if you're immune system is suppressed (old, very young, pregnant, or otherwise vulnerable to infection) then you should definitely keep to the printed \"use by\" dates and don't eat things after a few hours at room temperature or a few days in the fridge. This stuff may be lightly contaminated but still safe for most people, but it may be dangerous if your immune system can't handle the extra bacteria. You can still cook with it if you cook it thoroughly, but just be cautious.",
            "Somewhere in-between. The milk is no longer plain milk, it has combined with other ingredients in new combinations, and been cooked (which kills bacteria). But there are so many variables in the milk, the other ingredients, cooking time, and so on, that it's tough to set a new expiry date.",
            "In that case, you've heat killed the bacteria and other harmful pathogens that could grow in it. Chemically, the milk reacts with the other ingredients resulting in a new mixture that may or may not be sustainable for pathogens.",

This operating system, known as \"Windows NT kernel,\" is the foundation upon which all modern Windows operating systems are built. But what exactly is this kernel, and how does it enable Microsoft to create its iconic Windows operating systems?\n\n**A Brief History**\n\nThe Windows NT kernel has its roots in the 1980s, when Microsoft was developing its first graphical user interface (GUI) operating system, Windows NT 3.1. At the time, the company was working on a new operating system that would eventually become Windows NT 4.0, which was released in 1996. This kernel was designed to be a robust and scalable operating system that could support a wide range of hardware configurations and applications.\n\n**Key Features**\n\nThe Windows NT kernel is a 32-bit and 64-bit operating system that provides a solid foundation for Windows development. It is designed to be highly reliable, secure, and efficient, with features such as:\n\n* **Memory Management**: The kernel manages memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring that applications run smoothly and efficiently.\n* **Process Management**: The kernel handles process creation, execution, and termination, allowing multiple applications to run concurrently.\n* **I/O Management**: The kernel manages input/output operations, enabl",
