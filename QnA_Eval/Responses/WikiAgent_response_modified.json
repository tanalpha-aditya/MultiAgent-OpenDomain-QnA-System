        "response": "The classic catch-22! Gaining job experience can be a challenge when you're new to the job market, but there are several ways to overcome this hurdle:\n\n1. **Volunteer**: Look for organizations or causes you're passionate about and offer your skills on a volunteer basis. This can help you gain experience, build your network, and demonstrate your commitment to potential employers.\n2. **Internships**: Many companies offer internships to students or recent graduates.

This can be especially helpful for creative professionals or those in fields like writing, design, or programming.\n4. **Part-time or entry-level jobs**: Consider taking on a part-time or entry-level job to gain experience and build your skills. These roles may not be directly related to your dream job, but they can help you develop transferable skills and gain a foot in the door.\n5. **Create your own experience**: If you can't find a job or internship, create your own experience! Start a blog, create a YouTube channel, or develop a mobile app to demonstrate your skills and showcase your work.\n6. **Job shadowing**: Reach out to professionals in your desired field and ask if you can shadow them for a day or a week. This can give you a behind-the-scenes look at the industry and help you build connections.\n7. **Online platforms**: Utilize online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer to offer your services and gain experience. These platforms can connect you with clients and help you build your portfolio.\n8. **Networking**: Attend industry events, join professional organizations, or connect with people on LinkedIn to build relationships and learn about job opportunities.\n9. **Take online courses or certifications**: Invest in yourself by taking online courses or certifications to gain new skills and demonstrate your commitment to potential employers.\n10. **Highlight transferable skills**: Even if you don't have direct experience in your desired field, highlight the transferable skills you do have, such as communication, problem-solving, or time management. These skills are valuable in many industries and can help you stand out as a candidate.\n\nRemember, gaining job experience takes time and effort, but it's not impossible.

        "response": "The infamous bloodshot eyes after cannabis use! It's a common phenomenon, and I'm happy to explain the underlying mechanisms.\n\nCannabis use can cause bloodshot eyes due to the activation of the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the eyes to the brain. The main culprit behind this effect is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis.\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n1. **THC binds to cannabinoid receptors**: THC binds to cannabinoid receptors in the eye, particularly the CB1 receptors found in the trigeminal nerve. This binding causes a cascade of events that ultimately leads to increased blood flow and vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) in the eyes.\n2. **Increased blood flow and vasodilation**: The binding of THC to cannabinoid receptors triggers the release of various neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. These neurotransmitters stimulate the trigeminal nerve, leading to increased blood flow and vasodilation in the eyes. This increased blood flow causes the blood vessels in the eyes to become more visible, resulting in the characteristic redness or bloodshot appearance.\n3. **Constriction of the pupil**: THC also causes the pupil to constrict, which can contribute to the bloodshot appearance. This constriction is due to the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for regulating pupil size.\n4. **Increased tear production**: THC can also stimulate the lacrimal gland, leading to increased tear production. This can cause the eyes to become watery, which can further contribute to the bloodshot appearance.\n\nThe underlying physiological mechanism involves the complex interplay between the trigeminal nerve, cannabinoid receptors, and various neurotransmitters. The activation of these pathways leads to the characteristic symptoms of bloodshot eyes, including increased blood flow, vasodilation, pupil constriction, and increased tear production.\n\nIt's worth noting that the bloodshot eyes caused by cannabis use are usually temporary and reversible. They typically resolve within a few hours after the effects of THC have worn off. However, if you experience persistent or severe eye symptoms, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions.",

            "This is extremely common and well known to occur after smoking cannabis. The main compound in cannabis that gets you high, THC, is a powerful vasodilator! This means that THC lowers blood pressure and widens the veins and capillaries throughout your body, including the ones in your eyes, allowing for more blood flow to these areas. This dilation of blood vessels is also why many people experienced a flushed/red face when high on cannabis, and the drop in blood pressure explains why many people may feel dizzy while high.",

        "input": "What are the current public opinions and historical perspectives in Germany regarding Adolf Hitler and his actions, and how do these views differ across generations? \n",
        "response": "In Germany, Adolf Hitler and his actions are widely regarded as a dark chapter in the country's history, and the public opinions and historical perspectives on him have undergone significant changes over the years. Here's an overview of the current views and how they differ across generations:\n\n**Current public opinions:**\n\n1. **Rejection of Hitler and Nazism:** The majority of Germans today strongly reject Hitler and the ideology of Nazism. A 2020 survey by the German Marshall Fund found that 92% of Germans consider Hitler's regime to be a \"dark chapter\" in German history.\n2. **Remorse and guilt:** Many Germans feel a sense of collective guilt and responsibility for the atrocities committed during the Nazi era. This sentiment is reflected in the country's post-war efforts to come to terms with its past, including the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n3. **Education and remembrance:** Education plays a crucial role in shaping public opinions about Hitler and Nazism. The German education system places a strong emphasis on teaching about the Holocaust and the Nazi regime, ensuring that future generations understand the dangers of extremism and the importance of democracy and human rights.\n\n**Historical perspectives:**\n\n1. **Initial denial and silence:** Immediately after World War II, many Germans were in denial about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. This silence was partly due to the trauma and shame associated with the war, as well as the fear of being associated with the Nazi ideology.\n2. **Post-war reckoning:** In the 1950s and 1960s, Germany began to confront its past through various initiatives, such as the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany and the creation of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. This marked the beginning of a process of coming to terms with the Nazi era.\n3. **Historical research and documentation:** In the 1970s and 1980s, historians and researchers began to uncover new evidence about the Nazi regime, leading to a greater understanding of its atrocities and a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of German history.\n\n**Generational differences:**\n\n1. **Older generations:** Those who lived through World War II or were born shortly after (born between 1920 and 1945) tend to have a more personal connection to the Nazi era and its consequences. They may have experienced the war firsthand, lost loved ones, or been affected by the post-war period.\n2. **Middle-aged generations:** Those born between 1945 and 1965 have grown up with a strong emphasis on education and remembrance, which has shaped their understanding of the Nazi era. They may have learned about the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities in school and have a more nuanced understanding of the period.\n3. **Younger generations:** Those born after 1965 have grown up with a more comprehensive understanding of the Nazi era and its consequences. They may have learned about the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities through school, media, and popular culture, and are more likely to view Hitler and Nazism as a dark chapter in German history.\n\nIn summary, the current public opinions and historical perspectives in Germany regarding Adolf Hitler and his actions are characterized by a strong rejection of Nazism, a sense of collective guilt and responsibility, and a commitment to education and remembrance. While there are differences across generations, the majority of Germans today share a deep understanding of the atrocities committed during the Nazi era and a commitment to ensuring that such events never happen again.",

            "American lady married to a German man and we currently live in Germany. Germans have it beat into them from a very early age that the Holocaust was horrible. That there is no excuse for what Hitler did. That you do not put country above being a human being. If am correct it took up the majority of their history lessons (this does not mean that they at unaware of the world). Secondly, TV here is forever running documentaries on the holocaust and WWII. I am pretty sure I have seen footage at least once a day. Third, I have never been in a place where people are so quick to defend a person being verbally or physically attacked by another person. On the train I have seen many altercations (verbal) that generally ends with the asshole being called out by at least two other people (sometimes the entire train car gets pissed). So they aren't generally ones to stand by and let that shit happen. That being said it has caused some issues. In Germany it is illegal to argue facts of the Holocaust in public. The official story has not changed in a long time even with new data and facts present. Historians can lose their jobs or be arrested for trying to argue on the side of truth. So, there is that. It has also made racism a very difficult thing to talk about. No one wants to talk about the fact that German citizens with Turkish parents are still treated like subcitizens ....but they are. Lastly, this does not mean that Germans don't have a sense of humor about Hitler. I would, however, suggest that if you crack a Hitler or Holocaust related joke that you know the person you are talking to very well and refrain from doing so in public. People are very vigilant when it comes to anything Nazi related. Graffiti is covered quickly after the police are contacted. Edit: to be clear Germans dislike Hitler. There is no type of worship on the part of the German people..some even still feel guilty. Some don't like joking about him. Overall the German people feel a duty to not sit by and allow a new Hitler to do what Hitler did. So, they study history and they talk about it.",

Hence, I don't think I have any kind of responsibilty towards the jewish people. So that's the other side of the coin: You should not say anything against jewish people because you will instantly be called a Nazi. It's complicated.",
            "Yeah I think more about the mass ammount of people who supported him. They are just as delusional as him.",
            "Almost all of us think of him as one of the worst human beings ever.",
            "I know a few Germans, and whenever the Nazis or Hitler are brought up, they get kind of quiet and have a look of shame on their face. One who was more open to talking about it says many Germans would go back in time and undo what Hitler did. As mentioned before, my friend said there are many laws restricting Nazi propaganda and racism in particular. Last main thing he pointed out is \"If you go anywhere in Germany asking where Dachau is [one of the concentration camps and now a historical museum for those who don't know], many will pretend they have never heard of it,\" and he continued by saying it's because there are people in denial, not because they are dicks and refuse to believe any of it happened, but because they feel guilty of the country's past and wish it never happened. Hope this answers your question, sorry it was so long :P"

        "response": "The claim that Obamacare primarily benefits \"welfare ridin', foodstamp collectin' dead beats who don't work\" is a gross misrepresentation of the program's intended beneficiaries and effects. Here's why:\n\n1. **Obamacare is designed to help working Americans**: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed to address the issue of millions of Americans who lacked health insurance, many of whom were working but couldn't afford coverage. The law aimed to increase access to healthcare for those who need it, regardless of their employment status.\n2. **Most beneficiaries are working-age adults**: According to a study by the Urban Institute, in 2019, about 70% of Medicaid expansion beneficiaries (a key component of Obamacare) were working-age adults (ages 18-64). This group includes individuals who are employed, self-employed, or looking for work.\n3. **Obamacare has helped millions of working families**: The ACA has expanded coverage to millions of Americans, including those who are working but struggling to afford healthcare. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2019, about 20 million people gained health insurance coverage through the ACA's Medicaid expansion and marketplace plans.\n4. **The program has also helped small businesses and entrepreneurs**: The ACA's small business health insurance marketplaces (SHOP) and tax credits for small businesses have helped entrepreneurs and small business owners provide health insurance to their employees.\n5. **Obamacare has improved health outcomes and reduced costs**: Studies have shown that the ACA has led to improved health outcomes, reduced hospital readmissions, and lower costs for patients with chronic conditions.\n6. **The program has also helped reduce poverty and income inequality**: By providing health insurance coverage to low-income individuals and families, the ACA has helped reduce poverty and income inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Obamacare primarily benefits \"welfare ridin', foodstamp collectin' dead beats who don't work\" is a gross misrepresentation of the program's intended beneficiaries and effects. The ACA is designed to help working Americans, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, and has had a positive impact on health outcomes, costs, and poverty rates.",

            "This is a fair view. If you have no money and no insurance, under Obamacare you will get some care. This care will be paid for by your parents' tax dollars. That said, this is: * a) Already true. Homeless, pennyless folks can walk into an emergency room and receive care for their major injuries/illnesses, and your parents are gonna pay for that. * b) Cheaper. Homeless, pennyless deadbeats can get PREVENTATIVE care for free under Obamacare, and that care is way cheaper than fixing the problem later when it's about to kill them and they come into the emergency room. * c) Gonna help your parents. Maybe, god forbid, your Dad gets cancer. The stress makes him do worse at work and he's fired. He is uninsurable. Nobody would cover him, since he has cancer, a pre-existing condition if there ever was one. Under Obamacare, he can (and in fact is required to) still be insured.

Welfare, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, etc. The biggest of these were set up in the 30's during the Great Depression. It was Roosevelt's New Deal. So, it's not like President Obama created those. Obamacare was called by many as the completion of the New Deal. It fills in the last missing piece, (nearly) universal health care. I think the simplest justification comes down to this. Are we a nation that lets its poorest citizens die because they can't afford health care? If not, then we all need to chip in to help.",
            "This is already true. Your parents live in a fantasy world where they don't already pay for other people's healthcare. If \"foodstamp collectin' dead beats\" can't afford a visit to a doctor they can just walk into an ER and skip out on the bill instead. They'll potentially have bill collectors after them but if they are genuinely poor little will be gained by that. People who can and do pay their medical bills pay more to make up for those people. The key point to note is that ER care is the most expensive possible way someone like that could receive treatment. A doctor's visit may only be around $200 to treat a common ailment, but given the person was unable or unwilling to pay they just cost us all a $2,000 ER visit. **tl;dr** Your parents can either pay the \"dead beats'\" $2,000 ER bill (no ObamaCare) or pay the \"dead beats'\" $200 doctor bill (ObamaCare). The third option where they don't pay either is a figment of their imagination.",

If we don't, then we're letting honest unemployed people - people who are genuinely trying to find a job - we're saying they don't deserve health care if they get sick. We're saying that they're so worthless that if they get sick, they should literally *die*. Is that really what we've come to as a society, to say that if you're between jobs, then you're a worthless human being who deserves to die of an untreated sickness? I find that view repugnant.",
            "Huh, I'll be the first person to say \"Not really\", and I'm Republican who strongly oppose Obamacare. The \"my money\" part of your parents statement doesn't work. Very little money is being reallocated from your parents taxes to the poor as a result of Obamacare. Obamacare is paid for in two major ways, and a lot of minor ways. The major ways are cuts to Medicare, and taxes on the rich. The minor ways are increasing the burden on states via Medicaid (Supreme Court undid some of this, saying it can't be forced on states), increasing taxes in a few areas like tanning beds, and making some people pay more in taxes by decreasing flexible spending caps. If your parents were very rich, they have a point. If they are Medicare recipients, they sort of have a point, but their point would be saying \"Some of our future planned entitlement money is being used as an entitlement for another group.\" Overall, for the average American, Obamacare doesn't shift much money around from what they pay or to where it goes.",
            "An economist would say healthcare has a [positive externality]( URL_0 ). You can look at it like this: * The amount a person buys of a good (eg doctor visits) is based on how many they want and how much they can afford. This is referred to as the **private benefit**. * There are some things you can buy that make everyone better off. For example: going to the doctor every time you are sick will make you less likely to make other people sick. This is referred to as a **public benefit**. * Because only the private benefit is taken into account when someone is buying something, people buy less of a good than is **socially optimal** (private benefit + public benefit) * Governments give money to people so that they will buy more of these goods in order to make everyone else feel better (ie get closer to the socially optimal amount of consumption). Positive/Negative externalities are the driving force behind a lot of government policy. Edit: Formatting",

Ask whether Government should provide free schooling for those same freeloading poor people? And free roads too for those too poor to use private toll roads?

        "response": "Edward Snowden could not return to the United States and face charges because he was indicted for espionage and the US government had revoked his passport, making it difficult for him to travel. He opted for asylum in Russia instead, where he was granted temporary asylum in 2013 and later became a naturalized citizen in 2022.",
        "gold_answer": [
            "[In his own words]( URL_0 ):  >  A number of detractors have suggested that if Snowden, who disclosed controversial top-secret N.S.A. programs to reporters, truly wanted to commit an act of civil disobedience for reasons of conscience, then he should have faced the legal consequences, making his case to the American public while standing trial at home.  >  When I asked why he didn’t take this route, Snowden said that because of the way national-security laws have been interpreted since September 11, 2001, he believed that the government had deprived him, and other whistle-blowers, of ever having the opportunity to make their cases in this time-honored tradition. Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, “It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.”)  >  Snowden said that he would “love” to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, “I have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they’re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I’m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so. But they’ve declined.”  >  Instead, Snowden said, “They want to use special procedures. They want a closed court. They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.” So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn't believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a \"show\" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently.",
            "No one has mentioned this yet or at least not very succinctly: The crime he is accused of (Violating the Espionage Act of 1917) doesn't allow you to defend yourself and the Supreme court has previously ruled this is not a violation of free speech. I feel like more people need to know that.",
            "The Supreme Court wouldn't need to get involved here. ~~They generally only get involved in constitutional issues (that is, interpreting the United States Constitution).~~ Snowden committed a crime, there's no two ways about it. What he did may or may not have been morally or ethically right or wrong, but under current law, he committed a crime. Even if SCOTUS finds what the NSA did to be illegal, it still wouldn't exonerate him of his crime.",
            "He could, but he's afraid that he would lose. Which is reasonable, seeing as he almost certainly would. Even *if* we make the incredibly generous assumption that there's no corruption in the American government, and that there's no incentive to protect the NSA, Snowden still committed a crime. Someone else doing something illegal doesn't usually give you the right to also do something illegal. So it's entirely possible that while the NSA will be penalized for their actions, so will Snowden. And that's really the best case scenario, seeing as there *is* likely incentive for the government to protect the NSA. Or worse, there might be actual *justification* for the NSA's actions, which will seriously hurt any of Snowden's defenses. So even if he gets a fair trial he'll probably be found guilty, and it's certainly a reasonable fear that he wouldn't get a fair trial. Coming back is really a no-win scenario for him.",
            "Alright since this is explain like I'm 5.... Ever see a bully on the playground harassing other kids, not letting them live their lives fairly, creepily monitoring their movements? Imagine if you exposed that bullying to everyone in town and move across state to avoid him. Then, the bully says, \" hey man its okay, just come talk with me in private and let's work this out? I promise I'll treat you fairly!\" Would you walk right into a sucker punch?",
            "Get real. He will never get a proper and fair trial in the US. He will either \"have an accident\" or \"commit suicide\".",
            "Are you really asking why the government wouldn't give Snowden a fair trial for exposing the government? Just think about it for a moment. It doesn't matter what the laws are, the government made and enforces the laws. He leaked stuff that the government did not want leaked. He would not get a trial, he would just be detained indefinitely, and indefinitely might as well mean eternally because only a super hero would ever be able to break him out, not any kind of lawyer, not even the next president or 5 presidents from now. That is what happens when you try to expose your own government, in nearly any country. America is no exception. There's your ELI5 answer.",
            "Hypocrisy. If you look at what Snowden released the gist of it is that the U.S. security apparatus (NSA in this case) is spying on everyone in the world including American citizens (without a wire tap warrant signed by a judge, aka due process) and foreign heads of state ( a breach of diplomatic protocol). Snowden let the public know what was going on. The powers that be call this treason and would like to do to him what was done to the Rosenbergs. Up to this point the government sounds both reasonable and consistent. Later, however, we find out that the Chinese are doing the same thing, as are the Brits, the Russians, and basically any country that bothers to do so is in fact doing so. Now the situation is that Snowden didn't release any information to the 'enemy' because like the U.S. they had it all to begin with. The only thing that Snowden did was to let everyone else know what the governments were doing. He pissed off bureaucrats, nothing more.",
            "* he doesn't believe he will be given a fair trial * even if he gets a fair trial, he pretty clearly broke that law, and likely will go to prison * he doesn't believe he will be treated fairly in prison",
            " > why couldnt Snowdens case reach the Supreme Court and a ruling in favor of Snowden Sure, that *could* happen. Or Snowden could be found guilty, have his appeal denied by the supreme court (or have them rule against him), and spend the rest of his life in prison for treason. He clearly doesn't want to take that risk.  > and/or an Amendment/Act created that would deem the activities of the NSA illegal? Such an act would not impact Snowden, because it wouldn't make what he did legal.",
            "Because he would die in a \"traffic accident\" before there was any hope. Also he technically broke a ton of laws(even though it was the right thing to do) the court would still lock him up",
            "You know how manning was treated? That's why. And he doesn't stand a chance, supreme court can't and won't help him.",
            "Someone like Snowden would be tried for treason and espionage. This isn't a larceny charge or even a murder charge, where fair trials are your right and the burden is on the prosecution to prove guilt. That's simply not the case here. If someone like Snowden ever made it to trial, it would not be the kind of trial you see on TV. In fact, it would probably be worst and more on-sided than Hussein's trial, and he was a monster.",
            "I just thought of something. Couldn't the defense argue that Snowden cannot be charged with violating the Espionage Act as he leaked the classified documents to Wikileaks, which is not a hostile government but closer to a corporation? Yeah he leaked classified information, but didn't actually hand it over to Russia so it isn't actually treason."

Her reign of 63 years and 216 days—which was longer than those of any of her predecessors—constituted the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India.\nVictoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After the deaths of her father and grandfather in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Victoria, a constitutional monarch, attempted privately to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.\nVictoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1840. Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet \"grandmother of Europe\".

        "response": "Rates of depression among adults have been increasing over the past few decades, and it's a complex issue with multiple contributing factors. Here are some possible reasons:\n\n1. **Changing societal factors**: The way we live, work, and interact with each other has changed significantly over the past few decades. The rise of social media, the gig economy, and the increasing pressure to constantly be connected and productive can contribute to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression.\n2. **Economic uncertainty and stress**: The global financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent economic instability have led to increased financial stress, job insecurity, and reduced social support networks, all of which can contribute to depression.\n3. **Lack of social connections**: The decline of traditional social structures, such as community organizations and social clubs, has left many people feeling disconnected and isolated.\n4. **Mental health stigma**: Unfortunately, there is still a significant stigma surrounding mental health issues, which can prevent people from seeking help and discussing their struggles openly.\n5. **Increased awareness and diagnosis**: As mental health awareness increases, more people are seeking help and being diagnosed with depression. This can create the illusion that rates are increasing, but it may also reflect a genuine increase in the prevalence of depression.\n6. **Demographic changes**: The aging population, changes in family structures, and increased rates of divorce and remarriage can all contribute to increased stress and depression.\n7. **Neurobiological factors**: Research suggests that depression may be linked to changes in brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in emotional regulation and reward processing.\n8. **Lack of sleep and physical activity**: The increasing prevalence of sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyles can contribute to depression.\n9. **Substance abuse**: The rise of substance abuse, particularly among young adults, can increase the risk of depression.\n10. **Genetic factors**: Depression can have a strong genetic component, and as our understanding of genetics improves, we may be better able to identify individuals at risk.\n11. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to traumatic events, such as natural disasters, violence, or abuse, can increase the risk of depression.\n12. **Lack of access to mental health services**: In some areas, there may be limited access to mental health services, which can exacerbate the problem.\n\nIt's essential to note that depression is a complex issue, and it's unlikely that a single factor is responsible for the increasing rates. Instead, it's likely that a combination of these factors contributes to the growing prevalence of depression among adults.",

            "Well Billy, it's like this... When you're young, being an adult seems like a really great thing. You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there's all that naughty stuff you're not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what \"they want to be when they grow up\". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don't really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You've got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you've got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You've also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you've got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don't pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you're not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you've never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you're going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it's going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can't afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there's all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won't, but... there's a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you're not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you've ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won't ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don't have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it's not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn't make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don't have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It's a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren't so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve. That's part of why people are depressed, Billy. And that's all without mentioning the wars and the suffering and the poverty in countries other than our own, places we would like to help because they're people just like us... but we're too busy struggling to get by ourselves, to really help them as much as we'd like. Grown up life is hard, Billy. I'm sorry.",
            "Being depressed is not at all like being sad, while a 5 year old might not see the difference it is pretty clear to anyone that suffers from depression that they are not quite the same. About the only thing you can tell a 5 year old is that a person suffering from depression has a brain that is telling them to be depressed. Sometimes medications help to make it harder for the brain to tell them to be depressed. That said, there are basically two types of depression, there is situational depression (and this usually has a large component of sadness with it) and there is chronic depression which is not really a \"sadness\" as much as a feeling of apathy and a lack of motivation. Brain chemistry is a very complicated and while we know a lot about what is happening, there is still much we do not know, so medications involve a lot of trial and error.",

Depending on the balance of the good and the bad, you'll say you had a good, or a bad day. Now imagine that I selectively dull your capacity to feel the good parts of the day. Most days will, on balance, be bad. That's depression, in a nutshell. It's not necessarily that you feel things are especially bad, it's just that you have a lot of trouble feeling that the good makes up for it.",
            "There is evidence that depression is quite over diagnosed and over medicated. ( URL_0 ) So, really, there may not be \"so many people\" with depression at all. Everyone who is depressed is unhappy, but not everyone who is unhappy is depressed.",

The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).\nThe series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States.  A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. Major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, love, and death.\nSince the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature, though the books have received mixed reviews from critics and literary scholars.

            "Paying overtime past 40 hours a week is required by law, otherwise companies wouldn't do it. People died to get labor laws like this to be passed so don't take it lightly. Staff cost money to train and maintain. Secondary costs like training, benefit, uniforms, insurance, etc cost money and the company has likely done the math and determined that paying staff overtime is cheaper in the long run then hiring more staff. It's also possible they are just badly understaffed and have to pay overtime because they can't get/retain enough people.",
            "In the US, hours worked over 40 in the defined work week must be paid at time and a half. Some states, CA, require overtime pay after 8 hours in a day. It is more efficient to pay overtime because additional employees cost more to train, onboard, recruit. Employer would have to pay more in benefits and employer tax as well.

        "response": "Selfie cameras, also known as front-facing cameras, produce horizontally flipped images because of the way the camera is designed and the way it captures images. Here's why:\n\n1. **Sensor orientation**: The image sensor in a selfie camera is typically mounted upside down, with the image sensor's surface facing downwards. This is because the camera is designed to capture images of the user's face, which is typically held in front of the camera.\n2. **Lens orientation**: The lens of a selfie camera is also designed to capture images of the user's face, which means it's oriented in a way that the image is captured with the user's face pointing downwards.\n3. **Image processing**: When the image is processed, the camera's software flips the image horizontally to correct for the sensor and lens orientation. This ensures that the image is displayed correctly, with the user's face in the correct orientation.\n\nOn the other hand, rear cameras (also known as primary cameras) are designed to capture images of the world outside the device, which means they don't need to flip the image horizontally. The image sensor and lens are typically mounted in a way that captures images with the correct orientation, so no flipping is needed.\n\nIn summary, selfie cameras produce horizontally flipped images because of the way the camera is designed to capture images of the user's face, while rear cameras don't need to flip the image because they're designed to capture images of the world outside the device.",

In order to increase user comfort, and especially on apps like Snapchat and Instagram, where looks are very important, developers mirror the image so that the user sees what they would in a mirror.",
            "Fun fact: on iPhones, the live preview of your camera in selfie mode is flipped so that it behaves like a mirror and you’re better able to easily handle it (we are taught from a young age to understand what a mirror does and how it behaves). However.... as soon as you take the photo, the image saved to your phone’s memory is unflipped, because otherwise when someone else looks at the photo, they’d realize it didn’t look like you because our faces are not perfectly symmetrical.",
            "Selfie cameras flip the picture so our brains interpret the image as a *mirror image.* In a rear facing camera, the image is not flipped. However, you are facing the opposite direction as the camera, making you perceive it as a mirror image.",
            "It's so that as you're taking the picture, things move the way you expect them to. If it didn't flip the front camera, you'd have a much harder time moving the camera/yourself into the position you want. Similarly, if they did flip the rear camera, you'd have a hard time moving correctly!"

It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.\nThe islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then subsequently developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. In 1769 the British explorer Captain James Cook became the first European to set foot on and map New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi which paved the way for Britain's declaration of sovereignty later that year and the establishment of the Crown Colony of New Zealand in 1841. Subsequently, a series of conflicts between the colonial government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of Māori land.

        "response": "A great question!\n\nDespite the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing the spread of diseases, there are several reasons why vaccinated individuals may still worry about their children contracting diseases from unvaccinated children:\n\n1. **Vaccine failure**: While vaccines are highly effective, they are not 100% effective. In rare cases, vaccinated individuals may still contract the disease, especially if they have a weakened immune system or are exposed to a large amount of virus.\n2. **Herd immunity**: Herd immunity is the concept that a sufficient percentage of a population needs to be vaccinated to prevent the spread of a disease. If a significant number of individuals are not vaccinated, the herd immunity is compromised, making it more likely for outbreaks to occur.\n3. **Vaccine-preventable diseases can still spread**: Even if a child is vaccinated, they can still be exposed to and potentially contract a vaccine-preventable disease if they are in close contact with someone who is infected, such as an unvaccinated child.\n4. **Risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers**: Some individuals may be infected with a vaccine-preventable disease but not show symptoms (asymptomatic carriers). These individuals can still transmit the disease to others, including vaccinated children.\n5. **Fear of outbreaks**: The fear of outbreaks, particularly of diseases that can have severe consequences, such as measles or pertussis, can lead vaccinated individuals to worry about their children contracting diseases from unvaccinated children.\n6. **Social and community concerns**: Vaccinated individuals may worry about the social and community implications of unvaccinated children, such as the potential for outbreaks to occur in schools, daycare centers, or other public places.\n7. **Lack of trust in vaccination**: Unfortunately, some individuals may not trust vaccines or the vaccination process, which can lead to concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, including the potential for transmission of diseases from unvaccinated children.\n8. **Fear of vaccine-preventable diseases**: Vaccinated individuals may still fear the consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as serious illness, hospitalization, or even death, which can lead to concerns about the potential for transmission from unvaccinated children.\n\nIt's essential to note that the risk of transmission from unvaccinated children is generally low, especially in areas with high vaccination rates.

However, that child can still get the measles. Similarly, say you have a kid who has been otherwise sickly, or is one of the rare, but not unheard of kids for whom the vaccine doesn't take. Or say you're an old person whose immune system has simply weakened overall. In any of these cases, the unvaccinated child is a danger.",
            "There is also the chance of enough un-vaccinated people acting as a \"breeding chamber\" for the illness, allowing it to mutate and infect vaccinated people. Considering the long duration before a new vaccine can be made and given out, this is a pretty damnable risk.",
            "unvaccinated children can house an illness while it mutates into a vaccine resistant form. Essentially, imagine it as if there is a triangle. A is the virus, B is the unvaccinated child and C is the vaccinated child. The virus cannot travel AC, but it can travel AB, then BC",
            "Vaccinations are not 100% effective, so someone who is vaccinated still may get the disease. As well, babies and other people who cannot be vaccinated are at risk of being infected by an unvaccinated child (or by a child who was vaccinated but who is still a carrier and who was infected by an unvaccinated child or adult.)",
            "*There are some people who are allergic to ingredients in vaccines and can't get some of them. *There are also people who are immuno-compromised in some way (perhaps from chemotherapy or from HIV), and they can't get vaccines. *Some infants aren't old enough for some vaccines. *There are some vaccines that can take multiple doses to be effective. For example, the whooping cough vaccine (DTAP), only protects about 60% of infants after the first dose. It isn't until after the 3rd or 4th dose (at about 12 months old) that almost all vaccinated babies are fully immune to whooping cough. In all of the above examples, those people rely on the immunity of those around them. When the vaccination rate in a community drops, it allows preventable diseases to spread if introduced. That's why people who can get vaccinated but don't put their entire community at risk.",
            "No, because vaccinations aren't 100% effective. So even if you vaccinate your child, there's like a 2% chance that, if exposed to a pathogen, they can still become infected. The best defense against this is everyone vaccinating their child. This is not to mention those children that have compromised immune systems and cannot receive vaccines."

        "input": "Why does over-the-air HD TV transmission require no buffering, while streaming HD video online requires a good internet connection and high bandwidth? \n",
        "response": "Over-the-air (OTA) HD TV transmission and online streaming HD video have different requirements because of the underlying technologies and infrastructure used for each.\n\nOver-the-air HD TV transmission:\n\n1. **Fixed infrastructure**: OTA TV transmission uses a fixed infrastructure, where the TV signal is broadcast from a central location (e.g., a TV tower) to a wide area. The signal is transmitted at a fixed frequency and power level, ensuring consistent quality and reliability.\n2. **Error correction**: OTA TV transmission uses error correction mechanisms, such as forward error correction (FEC), to detect and correct errors that may occur during transmission. This ensures that the received signal is accurate and reliable.\n3. **No buffering required**: Since the signal is transmitted at a fixed rate and with error correction, the TV receiver can decode the signal in real-time without the need for buffering. The TV can display the video and audio content as it is received, without any significant delay or interruption.\n\nOnline streaming HD video:\n\n1. **Variable internet connection**: Online streaming relies on a variable internet connection, which can be affected by factors like network congestion, packet loss, and latency. This can lead to buffering, lag, or poor video quality.\n2. **Dynamic bitrate adaptation**: To compensate for variable internet connections, online streaming services use dynamic bitrate adaptation. This involves adjusting the video bitrate and quality in real-time to ensure a smooth playback experience. However, this requires buffering to store the video data temporarily, which can lead to delays.\n3. **Buffering required**: Online streaming requires buffering to store the video data temporarily, allowing the player to adjust the bitrate and quality as needed. This buffering can cause delays, but it helps ensure a smooth playback experience and minimizes the impact of network fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, OTA HD TV transmission requires no buffering because it uses a fixed infrastructure, error correction, and a consistent signal transmission rate. Online streaming HD video, on the other hand, requires buffering due to the variable nature of internet connections and the need for dynamic bitrate adaptation to ensure a smooth playback experience.",

            " >  Curious how hd tv is easily sent over the air but hd video streaming online takes high bandwidth and a good internet connection. A television broadcast is like talking into a loudspeaker system to address an entire stadium. Video streaming online is like holding an individual conversation with every person in the stadium simultaneously.",
            "There is some buffering when receiving video OTA, the buffering happens immediately after tuning. With OTA the stream is always there, and it's always on, all you have to do is grab the first decipherable packet and start deciding, you know the next one will be along immediately because it's guaranteed, furthermore if you drop a packet there is nothing you can do about it, so the stream is encoded to be able to continue with minimum disruption but obvious glitches. With internet streams the computer fetches a bunch of data because it doesn't know for sure when the next packet is arriving, the connection might at any moment stop delivering packets for a few moments, so you have to have sufficient data available to ride the gap and this riding the gap /can/ be invisible if you don't run out of buffer, so streaming video will pause and recontinue from the same location because in some cases you can do it without the user noticing. Why the gaps happen is because the internet is a series of pipes of different diameter.... the wire from your house to the exchange can handle less traffic than the wire from the exchange upstream, so obviously when you request a big file somebody has to rate limit the transfer because the internet itself isn't going to hold huge files in transit, the way that any part of the network shows it's over capacity is to randomly not transmit a packet - so YouTube thinks it's sent you the next instalment, but you never receive it, think of what this would do to a game of chess by post, how do you know that your move has been lost in the post? The answer is to resend your last move if you don't get a timely response, but this delay when viewing video causes skips. The most obvious restriction you can ease is the one between yourself and the exchange, buying fast internet means less dropped packets which means less stalls and a faster refill of your video buffer.",
            "Adding on to the other excellent answers here, I will add that traffic and contention are an issue. You are probably aware about how sometimes Internet traffic can get slower based on how many people are using it. This is a major cause of buffering with video streaming, because you're sharing almost the entire length of the connection with many other people. When you watch HD TV over the air, this isn't a concern. Nobody else is using that bandwidth. It's all 100% reserved for the television station. It's a specific frequency range that is legally reserved for them -- so they have all that bandwidth, every hour of the day, every day of the week. Also, it's broadcast, so your TV doesn't have to interact with the source of the transmission -- just pick up the signal and show it. This means that it doesn't matter if one person is watching it or a million. The full signal gets to you."

        "input": "Why are emotions often amplified in the evening hours, particularly in the period leading up to sleep, and what are the physiological and psychological factors that contribute to this phenomenon? \n",
        "response": "Emotions are often amplified in the evening hours, particularly in the period leading up to sleep, due to a combination of physiological and psychological factors. Here are some of the key contributors to this phenomenon:\n\nPhysiological Factors:\n\n1. **Circadian Rhythm**: The body's natural circadian rhythm, regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), influences the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that affect mood and emotional regulation. As the day progresses, the SCN prepares the body for sleep by increasing the production of melatonin, a hormone that promotes relaxation and reduces alertness. However, this increase in melatonin can also lead to increased emotional sensitivity and reactivity.\n2. **Hormonal Changes**: The evening hours are characterized by a natural dip in cortisol levels, which can lead to feelings of fatigue, irritability, and emotional vulnerability. At the same time, the body's production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, appetite, and sleep, begins to decrease. This decrease in serotonin can contribute to feelings of anxiety, restlessness, and emotional intensity.\n3. **Sleep Pressure**: As the body prepares for sleep, the pressure to fall asleep can build, leading to increased anxiety, frustration, and emotional reactivity. This is often referred to as \"sleep pressure\" or \"sleep drive.\"\n\nPsychological Factors:\n\n1. **Day's Events and Reflections**: The evening hours provide an opportunity for reflection on the day's events, which can lead to rumination and emotional processing. This can amplify emotions, especially if the day was particularly stressful or emotionally charged.\n2. **Social and Environmental Factors**: The evening hours often involve social interactions, such as dinner with family or friends, which can trigger emotional responses. Additionally, the evening environment, including lighting, noise, and temperature, can also influence mood and emotional regulation.\n3. **Expectations and Anticipation**: The anticipation of sleep and the expectation of a restful night's sleep can create tension and anxiety, leading to increased emotional reactivity.\n4. **Mind-Wandering**: As the body prepares for sleep, the mind can wander, leading to increased rumination and emotional processing. This can amplify emotions, especially if the individual is prone to negative thinking patterns.\n\nIn summary, the combination of physiological factors, such as hormonal changes and sleep pressure, and psychological factors, such as day's events, social and environmental factors, expectations, and mind-wandering, contribute to the amplification of emotions in the evening hours. These factors can lead to increased emotional sensitivity, reactivity, and intensity, making it essential to develop strategies for managing emotions and promoting relaxation in the evening.",

Could be wrong: Nighttime is when you have a chance to reflect on your day, your decisions, etc. The typical distractions are all gone and so you have a chance to think more thoroughly about what you have experienced. There is also an evolutionary fear of the dark that exists in people and when people are afraid, their other emotions are naturally amplified as well.",
            "Im no genius on the matter but as i have been experiencing this for as long as i can remember i mostly think it has to do with two things, first of all when you go to sleep you are tired so your mind might be easier to manipulate in a way, therefore when tired and lying in bed thinking everything is a bit more extreme compared to usual with no rational thinking involved and the second reason is when you arent even tired and you still experience these extreme thoughts while lying in bed has to probably(at least i think) as others have said to do with that you are lying in bed and \"stuck\" there, you're to lazy to stand up get water to clear your mind so you just lie there in this loop of bad thoughts which just keep on getting worse over time.",
            "There are a couple of things at work here: 1) you aren't distracted by the workaday stresses of life. You have time to reflect and ponder the day, week, month, life, and so forth. 2) Your body is actually more receptive to dopamine, estrogen/androgen, and other chemicals it naturally produces during this time. It's an old evolutionary trait that allowed for us to be more alert during dangerous times, like night-time. So, in summation: no distractions and hypervigilance leads us to \"feel\" things more strongly at night.",
            "I could be wrong but maybe it has to do with the fact that not being fully awake could alter your sense of rationality and priority. Being tired makes you think differently since you aren't as alert, certain \"filters\" could be removed because you won't need them as you sleep (ie making decisions and thoughts that you may have while on autopilot shut off and you are left with the thought of everything)",
            "I think its also to do with how tired you are mixed with the fact that once you're in bed you have no more of that day left to think about so the only thing to think about is on a larger scale e.g. *your life*.",
            "People are talking about how nighttime is a quiet time where you have nothing to do and think about your daily decisions. I want to guess that it also has to do with sleeping and dreams. Dreams have been reported to contain mostly negative emotions, specifically stress. Even in good dreams, there's still usually an element that stresses you out. \"My house was a mansion this whole time?! Aw man, why didn't I know this before? What am I going to do with all this space now? If it wasn't a mansion, would my house have been less expensive?\" During sleep, it is believed that memories formed during the day are being stored away into long term memory. Dreams are believed to be the signals that the brain picks up on and erroneously interprets as perception during this process. It seems as though stressful memories are more likely remembered, so you know how to deal with stress later, and dreams are accidentally a way for you to practice dealing with stress without the risk of failure. Also, scientists performed experiments with people falling asleep hooked up to brain scanners. During early stages of sleep, they were woken up, but they reported that they didn't feel like they even began to fall asleep at all. This suggests that awake/asleep is more like a sliding scale, and we don't always know how conscious we are. Therefore, when you try to fall asleep, your brain is probably already preparing to store away stressful memories and have a dream.",

            "One problem with a world-wide currency is neatly demonstrated by Greece and the Euro. One major way that a country can deal with hard times is to allow, or even force, their currency to be worth less. That makes the things you, as a country, make cheaper, and things you buy from other countries more expensive. So the country loses less money paying for exports, and makes more money selling its now cheaper exports. They can also create new money to pay for government spending, creating employment and pulling the country back onto its feet. If there is only one currency, a country can't do this. Their citizens keep buying imports, and their exports remain too expensive, and they can't recover without cutting back hard on government spending, which makes the hard times worse.",

They can use the power to inflate or deflate the currency in order to deal with financial troubles, create a more favorable trading position, etc. Not being able to do these things can lead to serious problems. Imagine if you were a country with serious debts and a lagging manufacturing economy. It would really help to devalue your currency some. It makes your debts less valuable, and makes your manufactured goods cheaper for buyers. Now imagine you're in a currency union with a bunch of more economically successful countries and they don't want to devalue the currency. They want the currency strong, and tell you to pound sand.

Control of a nation's currency results in tremendous power and responsibility. Being able to set their own inflation and interest rates can build a nation or bring it to it's knees. Giving up that control is not to be taken lightly. One only needs to look at Greece as an example of what happens if a country moves to a centralized currency shared with other countries before it's ready. With major economic and corruption issues, Greece was forced into default on it's loans. Another country may have been able to print more money, causing inflation, but it would have allowed it to pay it's bills at the expense of the buying power of it's citizens.

        "input": "Why does an airplane traveling at 600+ MPH feel slow to passengers, despite its high speed? \n",
        "response": "There are several reasons why an airplane traveling at 600+ MPH (965+ km/h) can feel slow to passengers, despite its high speed:\n\n1. **Reference frame**: When you're on a plane, you're not moving relative to the surrounding air, so you don't feel the wind rushing past you. You're essentially moving with the air, which makes the experience feel more like a gentle cruise.\n2. **Lack of visual cues**: At high altitudes, the visual cues that help us perceive speed, such as trees, buildings, and roads, are absent. This makes it difficult for our brains to estimate the plane's speed.\n3. **No sense of acceleration**: Unlike a car, which accelerates rapidly from 0 to 60 MPH (0 to 97 km/h), an airplane typically accelerates slowly and smoothly during takeoff. This lack of acceleration makes the experience feel slower.\n4. **Time dilation**: At high speeds, time appears to pass more slowly due to time dilation, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. While this effect is tiny at 600+ MPH, it can contribute to the feeling of slowness.\n5. **Psychological factors**: Passengers may be distracted by the in-flight entertainment, reading, or conversations, which can make the flight feel longer and slower.\n6. **Comparison to other modes of transportation**: When you're used to traveling by car or train, which typically operate at much lower speeds, an airplane's high speed can feel slower by comparison.\n7. **Lack of sensation**: Unlike a rollercoaster or a high-speed train, an airplane doesn't provide a thrilling, adrenaline-fueled experience. The smooth, gentle ride can make the flight feel slower and more relaxing.\n\nThese factors combined create the illusion that an airplane traveling at 600+ MPH feels slow to passengers, despite its impressive speed.",
        "gold_answer": [
            "There aren't any forces acting on your body that would make you feel that way, except for when you are accelerating to/from that speed. Every part of the airplane -- your seat, the floor, the air in the cabin -- is moving at the same speed as you are, so there is no way for your body to tell.",
            "The Earth is hurtling through the air at many times that speed. We feel acceleration and deceleration, a change in speed, and you definitely feel the acceleration for the first 20 minutes of the flight or so as you take off and ascend. That's why you stay in your seat! Your seat is attached to the plane so it's *pushing* you up to the speed. They get to that speed gradually so it's not too uncomfortable. But once you're at cruising speed and altitude, everything in the plane is moving at the same speed as the plane, so it's like your not moving at all. Speed is relative.",
            "The human body is not great at sensing speed in general, only acceleration. We have a bunch of senses that all work together to let us know when we're changing speed or direction, but we have to rely on context clues to get a sense of constant speed. The next time you're in a car (as a passenger) close your eyes while the driver is going a constant speed on a straight road. You'll notice that it won't feel different from sitting in a parked car. Your sense of speed in a car is largely dependent on seeing objects in the distance and seeing how you move relative to those objects. When you're in a plane, you don't get that kind of feedback. Even with a window seat, objects are so far away that we don't have a good concept of how fast we're traveling. When you're landing and taking off, you start to gain a sense of speed.",
            "Also parallax; all the items moving relative to you are either so foreign (clouds) or so far away (ground), it's difficult to judge how fast you're moving relative to them.",
            "You and the air inside the craft all accelerate with the aircraft. As long as the aircraft maintains a relatively steady speed, there are no forces acting on you that would indicate you are travelling fast. Then looking out the window at altitude, objects on the ground are so distant that you don't have a good reference to know how fast you are travelling. The best time to see how fast you are travelling as at takeoff and landing when you have a better reference as to your speed with objects on the ground.",
            "Because you don't feel velocity. You could be going a million miles an hour and you wouldn't know it. What you feel is acceleration, a change in velocity. On an ordinary plane flight, this occurs at the beginning (during takeoff) and at the end (during landing). You also feel it when the plane changes direction, which also requires a chance in velocity.",
            "Speed doesn't create a force - acceleration creates a force. That's also the reason why you don't feel the force of the earth rotating on its axis, or revolving around the sun at 30 km/second. What creates a force is a *change* in speed, which is what acceleration is. Picture yourself in a stopped car. You're going 0 miles an hour. Do you feel any forces? Not really, you're sitting still, things are good. Now imagine you slam on the gas pedal, going up to 60 mph. Now you feel a *force* because your speed is changing - your body is pressed backwards against the seat by that force. Now you hit 60 and you ease off the gas, maintaining a nice freeway speed. Do you feel any force while you're on the freeway? No, you feel just about the same as you did parked - if you opened a window you could feel the air moving, but inside of your car, everything is just the same as if you were going 0. Except now, slam on the brakes. You're decelerating and changing speed - a force pushes you forward, straining against the seatbelt. Once you hit 0, that force is gone. An airplane works the same way - you accelerate up to 600 mph slowly, so that the force isn't too overwhelming, but once you hit that speed and stop accelerating, it feels just the same as being still on the ground. Aside from any bumps or turbulence, which (just like in a car) change your acceleration by a little bit and affect you as forces.",
            "In an airplane, you don't have much of a frame of reference. The cabin is usually sealed off, so you don't experience the sensation of plane moving through air. Planes try to keep a pretty steady path. Which means you experience few forces due to acceleration once away from the airport. Planes fly pretty high off the ground. If you look out the window, you might be able to make out a few houses or cars at the ground level, moving pretty slowly across your massive plane of view. Their movement means nothing to you, thousands of feet above the ground or any other stationary object."

        "response": "What a fascinating question! Let's dive into the geological and physical consequences of digging a straight hole through the Earth's diameter.\n\n**Initial Impacts:**\n\n1. **Structural Disruption:** The sudden creation of a massive hole would disrupt the Earth's crust, causing widespread earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as the surrounding rock and mantle adjust to the new stress.\n2. **Mantle Convection:** The hole would create a massive void in the mantle, altering the convection currents that drive plate tectonics. This could lead to changes in the Earth's surface, such as the formation of new mountain ranges or the disappearance of existing ones.\n3. **Core Disruption:** The hole would also affect the Earth's core, potentially disrupting the flow of molten iron and nickel. This could impact the planet's magnetic field, leading to changes in the Earth's climate and potentially even the extinction of life.\n\n**Long-term Consequences:**\n\n1. **Gravitational Rebalancing:** The hole would create a significant imbalance in the Earth's gravitational field, causing the planet's rotation and orbit to slow down. This could lead to a longer day and a more elliptical orbit around the Sun.\n2. **Atmospheric Loss:** The hole would allow the atmosphere to escape into space, potentially leading to a significant loss of atmospheric gases, including oxygen and nitrogen. This could make the planet uninhabitable for most life forms.\n3. **Mantle Cooling:** The removal of heat from the mantle through the hole would cause the Earth's interior to cool, potentially leading to the solidification of the mantle and the formation of a new, more rigid crust.\n4. **Core Cooling:** The loss of heat from the core would also cause it to cool, potentially leading to the solidification of the core and the loss of the Earth's magnetic field.\n5. **Planetary Instability:** The hole would create a significant instability in the Earth's structure, potentially leading to catastrophic events such as massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and even the break-up of the planet.\n\n**Theoretical Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Hole Closure:** If the hole were to close, the Earth's structure would likely return to its original state, but with potentially significant changes to the planet's surface and interior.\n2. **Hole Expansion:** If the hole were to expand, it could potentially create a new, larger hole that would continue to disrupt the Earth's structure and mantle.\n3. **Hole Collapse:** If the hole were to collapse, it could potentially create a massive impact crater, potentially leading to the extinction of life on the planet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDigging a straight hole through the Earth's diameter would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's structure, mantle, core, and gravitational forces. The initial impacts would be devastating, and the long-term consequences would be far-reaching and potentially catastrophic. While this scenario is purely theoretical, it highlights the importance of understanding the Earth's internal dynamics and the potential risks associated with large-scale geological events.",

            "What would happen to the Earth? Probably nothing. If you made an instantaneous hole through the Earth and it wasn't being supported by anything, gravity would cause the solid core to fill the space immediately. The mantle will also fill in immediately. It would be like asking what would happen if you drilled a hole in the ocean. There might be a small earthquake that we can detect but that's about it. I'm not sure what will happen to the crust. Either you would have a very deep hole with a lava plug at the bottom, or a volcano. The earth has thousands of them, and the man made ones will probably be smaller than most, as it won't be over a hot spot or along a plate boundary. It would probably leak lava for a few days or weeks then stop and become extinct. Nothing that would affect very many people. If you could some how shield your hole to keep it form collapsing, nothing would still happen. The hole is too small and earth is too big. Gravity has to do with the mass of the planet, and the mass wouldn't change, or change by much, depending on what you did with the material in the hole, piled it up or simply disappeared it. The magnetic field also wouldn't be affected. Your hole is too small. If you had a hole a couple hundred miles across, you might get some of the apocalyptic effects you are looking for, but for a smaller hole, even one a mile wide, nothing exciting would happen.",
            "Simple answer: a perfect and in-destructible hole all the way to the core would start to spew hot liquified material through it. The gravity force on the outer layers would put pressure on the core which would force material through the hole. Edit1: I'm correcting myself based on the comments I have received. Edit1: The material might cool before it reaches the surface. That answer depends on the design of the hole. Edit1: Assuming the material did not solidify, the material would flow until is approximately reaches the surface. Once it gets close to the surface, the weight of the material in the column (hole) would balance out the gravitational pressure. There might be a bit of spew due to the momentum of the material. Since the core is denser than the rest of earth, on average, the material level would settle below earth's average surface. Edit1: I do not know if there is a place on earth where the surface is so far below the average that spewing core-material could happen. I would speculate something in the deepest trenches of the sea but that may not be the \"deepest\" place in this case. Since the earth diameter is smallest pole-to-pole then that might be \"deepest.\" Edit1: ~~Whether the material cools and seals the hole before raining death upon the planet is beyond me but I will speculate:~~ Edit1: ~~I would guess that, since the earth we still exist, then the hole would cool and seal up before raining massive destruction upon us. But...if the hole is insulated then there might be unimpeded flow to the surface.~~ Even if there is unimpeded flow to the surface, the next question would be whether the cooling at the surface caps the flow. ~~Again, since we still exist,~~ Since we still exist, the most likely answer is that the surface cooling would abate the flow.",

But addressing if the lava would spill out of the tunnel non-stop, the answer is no, at least from a hydrostatic point of view.

It's like saying \"what would happen to my brain in space?... You know... Assuming I don't freeze or expand or burn and can breathe...\" What?! But anyway... If this hole were to magically occur it would depend on wether it occurs spontaneously or if the process took a long time, like with actual tools and machines. The diameter of the hole is also extremely significant because, as you know, the earth rotates and land migrates. If the size were, say, 2 miles in diameter then it would surely cause fantastic earthquakes, tsunamis, and cyclones because the tunnel will collapse upon itself within 56 hours.

The Earth's core is a ball of solid metal the size of the moon. The problem is that this ball is rotating slightly faster than the surface. The tunnel would be lodged firmly in the core and would appear to be moving at about 10 meters an hour, shredding the crust as it goes along, cutting through it like a knife, drawing two giant east-west circles at the surface points of the tunnels. There wouldn't necessarily be volcanic activity (think you're on a floating ice slab and you drill a line in it with a power tool - water still doesn't come out because you're still floating just like continents float on a giant lake of molten rock inside the Earth), but there would definitely be earthquakes and volcanos might still errupt if the pressure below the crust happens to be high enough.",

            "This is really a question better put to AskScience, but according to my geologist father, nothing would happen. First, a man-size hole (or even car- or house-size) would be infinitesimably small compared to the earth itself. It's like wondering why all the water in your skin doesn't run out of your pores. Second, such a hole, made the way you describe, would in effect be a continuing part of the surface (mathematically speaking), since you can't admit any part of the interior without destroying the hole. You would indeed require extremely strong tools and materials, greatly exceeding the capabilities of anything we have. If that was possible, and you were able to make the hole, then the hole would, for practical purposes, not be a hole into the earth, but a tunnel from one side to the other, around which the interior would flow (and not likely notice it, due to the enormity of comparative scale). And if you *did* admit the interior, the hole would immediately fill with whatever matter was at the level you admitted, and then cool solid at the top. You probably would get some lava and such at first, depending on where you do it, but it would seize solid soon enough, and you'd be left with an interesting feature. Unless, as others have suggested, the hole is extremely large, in which case, sure, it could be dramatic. But this is like asking what happens if you hit the earth with larger and larger stones. Somewhere between nothing and oblivion is a Michael Bay movie, but it's not especially interesting even as a thought experiement, since it only points to various points on the curve of possibilities, rather than frame a more interesting question with more variables.",
            "I have read a couple of books that had this scenario. It really depends on what kind of hole you're talking about. But here's the one I really remember: If you had a 3-foot diameter hole that went from one side of the earth, straight through the center to the other side, with an impervious material lining the walls of that hole, not much of anything would happen. if you then vacuum-sealed that hole, and put a near-frictionless car and rail system inside, you would have an extremely low-energy transport from one side of the earth to the other. It would be quite a fast trip, starting with the approximately 32.2 feet per second per second \"free fall\" acceleration, and gradually decreasing to the center, then gradually increasing to bring you to a cushy, 1g stop on the other side of the planet.

Assuming our magnetic field was left intact, the question of where the material from the hole would end up arises. Wherever it was, a lot of the Earth's mass would now be there, which might skew the Earth's gravitational pull. I'm not an expert so I'm probably wrong.

            "I'm actually having a lot of fun with this, so I think this warrants a direct reply. First issue I see is that the cylinder would need to be filled with air. Some have suggested this would cause weather disturbances, and it might. I don't think it'd be big though. Assuming a 1m cylinder, the total volume would be about 0.08km3. That's pretty small, in terms of atmosphere. 1.0x10-9 % of the atmosphere. I'm not a meteorologist, but i don't think that'd cause anything other than a stiff wind for a while. This assumes a constant pressure, which is, of course, not realistic. The pressure is actually a bit of a monster. For curiosities sake, I'm playing with it. If you just do a straight exponential calculation, assuming the mechanics all the way down are the same as on the surface, you'd get 2.145x1013 kPa. That's 20 000 000 000 the surface pressure, and more than enough to create what's called a supercritical fluid. At those pressures, the gases would actually \"condense\", but not in the conventional sense. It's a very strange state of matter that's tough to ELI5. However, this is not the case. Earth is not a point mass, and the gravitational force pulling on the air column would not be constant. So I'll fiddle with the calculus a bit more for fun, and let you know what it comes out to. [EDIT: I worked it out as far as I could, but apparently I broke WolframAlpha trying to solve it. So we may be out of luck here.] As for the magnetic field, I did't read anything that'd say it would be an immediate issue. Our magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core, which is driven by tidal forces caused by the Sun. A 1m radius tube would likely not cause a significant disruption here. The core is a problem though. The dynamics of the inner core are not well know, but most geologists agree that it's a solid (some imply a highly compressed liquid that acts solid, and a few other theories, but solid core seems to dominate). So we've just drilled a hole through a solid core. A core that has a faster angular rotation than the surface. So one of two things would happen: either the core would continue to rotate, and we would lose the tube pretty quick, or the core would stop relative to the surface. Not imagine how much angular energy is stored in a rotating, massive, sphere of highly dense nickel-iron alloy. That would all need to go somewhere.I don't know exactly how it'd be dispersed, but it would be like trying to stop a huge flywheel, and the results would likely be catastrophic. Extinction event catastrophic. The last issue, all the rest aside, comes down to temperature and radiation. The Earth's core is in the ballpark of 4 000K (about 4 300C, or 7 800F). There is no known substance that could shield from that heat, or any cooling method to avoid melting/combusting pretty much anything thrown in. Then there's the radiation. I couldn't find any exact numbers on concentration, so it's tough to find an exact dose. However, the Earth as a whole is estimated to produce 20TW of radioactive energy. So I'll go out on a limb and guess that the level would be past the lethal dose for a person, and probably irradiate any inorganic object going through. Let's assume that all this is a non-issue, for fun. Just to examine the timeline of jumping in. Since we are ignoring the fatal pressures, temperatures, and the like, let's just assume a complete vacuum. The number most people use to traverse the diameter of the planet is about 42 minutes, which isn't too bad (This number would not be affected by equatorial bulge, and would not have any significant difference due to elevation changes. Height is not a variable in a perfect pendulum). You'd hit about 11 000m/s at the core, assuming constant acceleration (some people are saying 8 000m/s. Not the number I got, but either way, it's crazy fast). Now, as you probably know, a perfect pendulum will reach exactly the same height at which it was dropped. Same for you. The elevation variations in the Earth's surface vary by about 0.22%. Not enough to make a significant difference in travel time, but definitely enough to make an impact on your arrival. So you'd likely fall short and oscillate infinitely. If there was any source of energy loss, you'd eventually settle at the core, experiencing zero G. Doesn't sound fun to me. However, you would also have angular velocity. Since the radius of rotation decreases with the descent, your relative lateral velocity would increase, and you'd end up riding the side of the tube all the way down, like a slide. Even though it's straight down, you'd fall kind of like it's angled. By the time you hit the core, all of the lateral energy would be gone. As you ascended, you'd now have *less* angular velocity than the tube, and slide all the way back up. Obviously, all this friction is a huge problem, and would pretty much destroy any hope you had of reaching the other side, unless we extended the hypothetical to include a frictionless tube. TL;DR This would be a very bad thing. You'd either destroy the planet, waste a lot of resources for something that wouldn't last, or inevitably become stuck in the core of the Earth forever. So let's not build this, okay? EDIT: Please feel free to review my statements. What I've found is hardly the gospel truth. Some of the theories I referenced are not completely accepted, some of my math may be off, and some is wild speculation. I mostly did this because I answered a few points, started digging, and then this behemoth formed.

        "input": "What is the sensory experience of smell like for humans, and how does it compare to the experience of other animals? \n",
        "response": "What a fascinating question!\n\nThe sensory experience of smell, also known as olfaction, is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in human perception and behavior. For humans, the sense of smell is closely tied to memory, emotion, and cognition, and is often described as a nostalgic and evocative experience.\n\nWhen we smell something, our brain processes the information through a network of specialized cells in the nasal cavity, called olfactory receptors. These receptors are responsible for detecting odor molecules, which are tiny particles that are released by objects and substances in our environment. The information from these receptors is then transmitted to the brain, where it is interpreted and processed in conjunction with other sensory inputs, such as sight and sound.\n\nThe experience of smell for humans is often described as:\n\n1. **Subjective**: Smell is a highly subjective experience, meaning that what one person perceives as a pleasant or unpleasant odor may be different for another person.\n2. **Emotional**: Smells can evoke strong emotional responses, such as nostalgia, comfort, or anxiety, and are often linked to memories and experiences.\n3. **Context-dependent**: The same smell can have different meanings or associations depending on the context in which it is encountered.\n4. **Limited**: Humans have a relatively limited range of olfactory receptors compared to other animals, which means we are less sensitive to certain smells and have a more limited ability to detect subtle differences in odors.\n\nCompared to other animals, the sense of smell in humans is relatively underdeveloped. Many animals, such as dogs, have a much more developed sense of smell, with thousands of olfactory receptors in their nasal cavities. This allows them to detect and distinguish between a wide range of smells, including subtle differences in scents.\n\nSome notable differences in the sense of smell between humans and other animals include:\n\n1. **Dogs**: Dogs have up to 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to only 6 million in humans. This allows them to detect scents that are too faint for humans to detect.\n2. **Bees**: Bees have specialized olfactory receptors that allow them to detect the sweet, floral scents of nectar-rich flowers, which are essential for their survival.\n3. **Sharks**: Sharks have a highly developed sense of smell, which they use to detect prey and navigate their surroundings.\n4. **Elephants**: Elephants have a keen sense of smell, which they use to detect water sources, food, and potential threats.\n\nIn conclusion, the sensory experience of smell is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in human perception and behavior. While humans have a relatively limited sense of smell compared to other animals, our brains are highly attuned to the emotional and cognitive aspects of smell, which can evoke powerful memories and emotions.",

            "I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind. Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound. I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles. Maybe you can get a general feel for what people are saying by watching lips (so long as they face you), but you miss out on the effects of the background music for setting mood and all the foley effects. [Edit: Missing a word.]",

            "Many of the responses here deal with the emotional response that smelling something produces. I think that's good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there's still a link in the chain there that's missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I'm sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn't explaining anything that you don't already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that's just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I'm a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I'm keenly aware of them and they can't be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can't ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That's generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren't overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you're just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don't linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after.",

            "I read an article about a woman who had a magnet in planted in her finger. This resulted in a new sense where she could feel magnetic flieds (like microwave ovens, high voltage lines, etc.) and detect near by metal. Thinking about this completely alien sense helped me to consider my other senses more objectively. So being able to smell actually gives you information about the chemistry of objects. Consider all the chemical reactions that take place in cooking; they result in differnt smells (and tastes). Smell can also tell you if fruit and vegiyables are ripe or even spoiled. Likewise of meat goes bad it give off a smell - kind of a warning. So you can think of that as being smiliar to being able to see or hear that information - since you get it from a distance. It it probably more similar to hearing since it doesn't require direct or uninterrupted \"line - of - sight\". Off all my senses, smell is the one that most often conveys bad information. For like in the case of spoilage, the smell is revolting. Like a loud sound, or a bright light. Smell is a really strong trigger for memories too. For many people smelling cookies reminds them of home. Or maybe certain foods remind them of holidays. The part of the brain that processes olfactory (smell) information is closely associated with memories. Because smell gets stronger the closer you get to the subject, it often times draws me in for smells I like (good food, a woman with nice colonge, the smell of the woods, etc.), or drives me away for ones I dislike (spoilage, feeces, filth, body oder, too much fragrance, etc).

My mother in law has no sense of smell, so she would always stick a finger in the diaper to veifiy - which is messy. I just look when I am unsure. Generally speaking smell is a way we learn things not to eat. There are some poisons that are adapted to smell good or not at all, but very few things that smell bad that are good for you (individual tastes aside). So smell is just another way to collect information at a distance from the world around us. Most of that information can be collected other ways too.

He and his writing partner Weingrod developed the idea as a project to star Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. When they were unable to participate, Landis cast Aykroyd—with whom he had worked previously—and a young but increasingly popular Murphy in his second feature-film role. Landis also cast Curtis against the intent of the studio, Paramount Pictures; she was famous mainly for her roles in horror films, which were looked down upon at the time. Principal photography took place from December 1982 to March 1983, entirely on location in Philadelphia and New York City. Elmer Bernstein scored the film, using Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera buffa The Marriage of Figaro as an underlying theme.\nTrading Places was considered a box-office success on its release, earning over $90.4 million to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the Uni",

Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit.",

Normally this wouldn't matter, because you are supposed to buy and hold stocks, but they were buying what's called 'futures'. In a nutshell, they were buying contracts that afford them the legal right to purchase units of OJ at a specific price. Since they knew the price of OJ would fall (remember the dude with the locked briefcase?) they were buying option contracts to purchase OJ at a higher price. Anyone with half a brain would sell them these and of course that's what happened. For in depth knowledge, look up \"how futures trading works.\"",
            "The unrealistic part of that flick is not the trading but Winthorp and Valentine being able just to waltz in to that pit and stand wherever they want. Spots in a commodity pit are protected like gang turf. They just go in and stand in the middle. Also if they deposit the cash from everyone's savings lets say 100k and the margin per contract is 5k per contract they can only buy or sell 20 contracts. I don't know what the FCOJ margins are, but if they trade more than 20 the profit goes to the exchange. At least that's how the CME rolls.",

They should've bought very little contracts of fcoj which would sell out in 1min with that frenzy and then the buyers would go somewhere else and price would rise even beyond $1.42 2. They all look at the clock and then 9am (I think) strikes and crop report is read. Then they all panic because they need to unload whatever they bought and finding the 2 buying they sell ASAP. Again how can these 2 buy everything with so little money? 3. Finally the closing bell strikes and trading stops. How did all this scheme happen so fast ? Doesnt trading happen 9:30am to 4pm at NYSE (why wtc was shown?) for such commodities. Did they spend that many hours there? It just seemed sudden and abrupt the time flow.",

In reality I think it would've been the firm that they trade through and that provided them the loan in the first place. (margin call means pay back the loaned amount) edit: maybe I had it backwards and the dukes were going to go long on OJ futures, but it's the same principle. margin call did them in after the market worked against them based on their false knowledge.",

The copper-clad statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.\nThe statue is a figure of a classically draped woman, likely inspired by the Roman goddess of liberty Libertas. In a contrapposto pose, she holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. With her left foot she steps on a broken chain and shackle, commemorating the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War. After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.\nThe idea for the statue was conceived in 1865, when the French historian and abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence (1876), the perseverance of American democracy and the liberation of the nation's slaves.

        "input": "Why did documentary channels like History, Discovery, TLC, and Nat Geo shift their focus from traditional documentaries to reality TV? \n",
        "response": "Documentary channels like History, Discovery, TLC, and Nat Geo shifted their focus from traditional documentaries to reality TV for several reasons:\n\n1. **Ratings and audience engagement**: Reality TV shows tend to attract a larger and more engaged audience than traditional documentaries. Reality TV shows often feature dramatic storylines, relatable characters, and a sense of competition, which can lead to higher ratings and increased viewer loyalty.\n2. **Cost-effective production**: Reality TV shows are often less expensive to produce than documentaries. They typically involve following real people or situations, which can be done with minimal equipment and crew, whereas documentaries often require extensive research, filming, and editing.\n3. **Increased advertising revenue**: Reality TV shows can attract more advertisers due to their larger audience and more engaging content. Advertisers are willing to pay more for ad space on shows that attract a larger and more engaged audience.\n4. **Competition from cable and streaming services**: The rise of cable and streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime has increased competition for traditional documentary channels. To stay competitive, these channels needed to adapt to changing viewer habits and preferences.\n5. **Changing viewer habits**: The way people consume media has changed significantly over the past two decades. With the rise of social media and online platforms, viewers are now accustomed to consuming bite-sized, easily digestible content. Reality TV shows often fit this mold, with shorter episodes and more fast-paced storytelling.\n6. **Lack of government funding**: Many documentary channels, especially those focused on educational or historical content, rely on government funding or grants. However, government funding for documentaries has decreased in recent years, making it more challenging for these channels to produce high-quality documentaries.\n7. **Shift in programming strategy**: Some documentary channels, like History and Discovery, have shifted their focus to more entertainment-oriented programming, such as reality TV shows, to appeal to a broader audience and increase their market share.\n\nBy shifting their focus to reality TV, these documentary channels have been able to adapt to changing viewer habits, increase their ratings and revenue, and remain competitive in a crowded media landscape.",

            "Production costs for most reality shows are extremely low, making those kinds of shows a lot more profitable than traditional programming.",
            "Alright, sit yo ass down and get ready for a story. The TLDR is indeed ratings and production cost. But if that's the why, we must ask ourselves \"why now?\" What happened to these stations, and why did it all happen at the same time? Well, the seed of change (or pestilence if you wanna be poetic) is TLC. Before The Channel Formally known as Learning gave us child beauty pageants and whatever the fuck Honey Boo Boo is supposed to be. You see, in 2007 Discovery was kind of in a hole. As you may know Discovery owns, TLC, Nat Geo, Animal Planet and more. Despite their wide net, the brand was tanking. So they brought in a man from NBC (who would soon sell out to Comcast) to liven things up. The Discovery Channel store was closed, the main station started doing documentaries more fit for history channel with \"True crime\" exploitation pieces. This would in turn hemorrhage viewership from History (A sister network of A & E) who began showing programs like Gangland. Modern Marvels (which had existed since 1995) got a shiny update, and the content of the History Channel become the closest content rival for Discovery. But then, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, or more accurately here comes TLC's shit shows. Ya see, part of the way Discovery was able to have so many networks was appealing to different demos for each one. History had been nailing the males over 40 crowd and discovery had been shooting for educated younger males. TLC was basically discovery channel marketed to women in their early 20s to early 30s, and you know what bored women of that age-range were watching? Soaps, MTV/VH1 reality shows and celebrity gossip. Taking a \"documentary\" series about child fashion shows and editing it like an MTV reality show with a healthy bit of exploitation (the fans of these shows are watching to laugh at these people, make no mistake) and they suddenly had a the right ingredients for what would become a network of cheep, exploitative, schlock across all Discovery Networks (well, except the Science Channel). So What really happened? What really changed? Demographics. Say what you will about these networks being crap, they do a good job of not internally fighting with each other for attention. The Honey Boo Boo crowd doesn't want much to do with \"are Megladon's still around\" the age range, income level, and general education of the demo they're trying to reach can be reliably expected to enjoy the TV click bait. They figured out something Buzzfeed did before you wanted to inexplicably punch it in the face: people don't want to learn, they want to have what they know and like confirmed. This is how Discovery Channels' most profitable stretch, year after year, is telling people sharks aren't violent murder machines (except when they are but it's okay because not to people) like it's the first time anybody has heard this information. Apologies to Shark Week fans, but how surreal is it that the most educational thing on the network is telling a demographic that didn't grow up with Jaws shit they already know from last year? And then there's history channel. History is, again, owned by A & E not discovery. History is a tougher nut to dissect. In short, as they became more direct competition for Discovery they began duplicating what was making discovery successful. Deadliest Catch became Ice Road Truckers, bad speculative science docs became Ancient Aliens. History duplicated the pacing of TLC and marketed it to men, but dumbed its content down to turn the stuff with potential to be good into a filter for Discovery Channel's scraps. A & E went the way of TLC and now theirs no real market incentive to change. If you really want to know whose to blame, look in the mirror. The original demographics have moved on. We're watching Netflix and are simply too educated to watch a show about convergent mermaid evolution. Discovery says they're gonna start making quality programming again, so demand might be returning as Millennials get more disposable income (Oh right, the other big reason! Because of the whole recession thing, cheaper shows became a must and Gen-Xers aged 34-48 had more money than the groups they were, on paper, marketing towards so include this disclaimer in the paragraph about TLC's market shift) and educated young people starting families in their late 20s is presenting itself as a important demographic to snag. In short: The Economy tanked around the same time as the networks underwent massive internal restructuring. Networks that were in mild competition with each other entered a full race to the bottom and neither one went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.",

            "When you're reading the constitution, if it says citizen, then you have to be a citizen to have that right. If it says person, then any human within the jurisdiction of the US has that right whether here legally or not. So, like the 5th and 14th amendments specify person, so they apply.",
            "There is a gigantic misconception among people that the Constitution gives us civil rights. As the Declaration of Independence says:  > We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In other words:  > It is obvious to all of us that every human being is born equal, and that all of us are born with certain fundamental rights that cannot be taken away; some, but certainly not all, of these rights are the right to be alive, the right to be free, and the right to choose how to live your life. The Constitution does not give us our human rights -- they're granted to us upon birth by God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever you believe to be the source of fundamental truth. Everyone has these rights. American or foreign, bad people, good people, your worst enemy. Saints, criminals, murderers -- everyone is born with fundamental rights and they *cannot be taken away* by human beings, because who are we to remove a gift bestowed by God? Because these rights are inherent, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights don't provide them; rather, the documents provide *prohibitions on the government* from infringing on the exercise of these fundamental rights we are all born with. The Founders believed that the best government would be one that honored and protected its citizens natural rights. Now, some infringement of our rights is necessary to provide for social welfare and order, but even here, it's more about balancing the exercise of our rights; e.g., when you deny a criminal his right to freedom in order to protect other people's right to live free of physical harm. These rights are distinct in the Constitution from the Privileges  &  Immunities of citizenship, which *are* the things that we are granted as Americans. These include things like the entitlement to vote, to travel freely between states, and to have free access to commercial markets. These privileges *are* granted by the government and *can* be taken away. The Constitution recognizes the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. So, yes, illegal immigrants have that fundamental right -- they were born with it, just as you are. However, as I said, the Founders and the Constitution recognize that complete anarchy leads to greater infringement on human rights (because the strongest just takes over as tyrant), so the government is allowed enact reasonable regulations that infringe on fundamental rights to the extent that they are necessary to protect social order and welfare. One of the infringements that's reasonable is prohibiting noncitizens from owning firearms -- it is reasonable for a nation to protect itself by preventing armed foreigners from roaming free within its borders.",
            "While many whip themselves into a lather, over the mistaken notion that illegal aliens are essentially given all the same rights and privileges as citizens, under our Constitution, it is important to point out that their guaranteed rights are not exactly the same as citizenship: Their protections stem from Section One, of the Fourteenth Amendment: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive **any person** of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to **any person within its jurisdiction** the equal protection of the laws.\"",
            "To buy a gun legally from an authorized FFL, you need to either be a citizen or have a green card. So, no, you don't have second amendment rights as an illegal.",
            "There are numerous laws which prohibit the possession of a firearm while in the commission of a crime. Illegal aliens by their very act of being here are committing an ongoing crime every second they're in the US without permission, hence being in the United States illegally and possessing a firearm is illegal.",
            "This is a case where there are some mixed decisions from federal courts. Some courts have found that illegal immigrants do have a right to bear arms, but many have not. The 7th Circuit, for example, found in 2015 that they do have a right to bear arms, but that a federal law prohibiting them from possessing firearms was somehow valid. Don't ask me how they figured that one. The 4th, 5th, and 8th Circuits have ruled that they do not have that right. What does that mean? It means this is a case that will likely be resolved eventually by the US Supreme Court."

The term cold war is used because there was no direct fighting between the two superpowers, though each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. Aside from the nuclear arms race starting in 1949 and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed indirectly via psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.\nThe US and USSR were both part of the Allies of World War II, the military coalition which had defeated Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945.

        "response": "The sensation of feeling \"love\" as a heavy feeling in the chest is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple physiological and neurological mechanisms. Here are some of the key contributors:\n\n1. **Oxytocin**: Often referred to as the \"love hormone,\" oxytocin is released during social bonding activities, including romantic love. It stimulates the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, which can lead to feelings of warmth and relaxation in the chest.\n2. **Dopamine**: As mentioned earlier, dopamine is released in response to oxytocin and is involved in the reward and pleasure centers of the brain. It can create a sense of euphoria and relaxation, which can manifest as a heavy feeling in the chest.\n3. **Serotonin**: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, appetite, and sleep. When serotonin levels drop, it can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress, which can manifest as a heavy or constricted feeling in the chest. In the context of love, serotonin levels may decrease as the body prepares for the stress of caring for a new partner.\n4. **Vagus nerve**: The vagus nerve is responsible for regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. When the vagus nerve is stimulated, it can cause a range of physical sensations, including a heavy or fluttering feeling in the chest. This is often referred to as \"heart palpitations.\"\n5. **Adrenaline**: Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is released in response to stress, excitement, or fear. In the context of romantic love, adrenaline can create a sense of excitement and nervousness, which can manifest as a heavy or racing feeling in the chest.\n6. **Brain regions**: The brain regions involved in processing emotions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala, are also active during romantic love. These regions can create a sense of emotional intensity and overwhelm, which can manifest as a heavy feeling in the chest.\n7. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal changes, such as the release of vasopressin and prolactin, can also contribute to the sensation of feeling \"love\" as a heavy feeling in the chest. These hormones can stimulate the release of oxytocin and dopamine, which can reinforce feelings of attachment and bonding.\n8. **Breathing and respiration**: Changes in breathing and respiration patterns can also contribute to the sensation of feeling \"love\" as a heavy feeling in the chest. When we're in love, our breathing patterns may become more shallow and rapid, which can create a sense of constriction or heaviness in the chest.\n\nIn summary, the sensation of feeling \"love\" as a heavy feeling in the chest is a complex phenomenon that involves the interplay of multiple physiological and neurological mechanisms. These mechanisms include the release of oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin, as well as changes in breathing and respiration patterns, and the activation of specific brain regions.",

In 1998, the franchise's fortunes would change drastically with the acquisition of Dirk Nowitzki, who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history, leading the team to its first NBA Finals appearance in 2006 and its only NBA championship in 2011.\nThe Mavericks later entered a rebuilding phase in the tail end of Nowitzki's storied career; although they missed the playoffs in three consecutive years from 2017 to 2019 (after which Nowitzki retired following his record-breaking 21st season with Dallas), the franchise's fortunes immediately rebounded once again with the acquisition of Luka Dončić (who was named the 2019 Rookie of the Year); the Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 2020, reached the Western Conference finals in 2022 for the first time since their 2011 championship, and reached their third NBA Finals in 2024.\nIn February 2020, the Mavericks sold out their NBA-record 815th c",

Look at at writing or at a clock. Note what the writing says or what time it is. Look away. Look back. If the writing is different, or the time is more than a few seconds off, you're dreaming. 2. Trace your steps back as far as you can. In a dream – even an extremely vivid, lucid one – you get stuck at some point and can't remember anything before that. While awake, you can trace your whole day back to when you woke up in your bed, then the day before, then the week before, etc. 3. Ask yourself if you're in a dream. Concentrate on your surroundings. Even if you're in a familiar place, is it how you remember it being? Are the physics around you the same? What about the behavior of those around you? 4. Hold your breath for as long as you can.

            "A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, it's certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google \"Xenu\" or \"Thetans\". There's a fairly recent book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it's gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you. But with so much social media these days I think they've had a hard time applying pressure on-line like they used to. **TL;DR** - It's mostly crazy bullshit, but *profitable* crazy bullshit.",
            "Well, not to speak on the actual religion's dogma (as most religions when examined are usually odd beliefs), the reason for controversy is the level of control they try to exert over their members, ex-members, and anybody who tries to criticize them. The means by which they have done this at times have been considered at a minimum, highly unethical or moral, or just plain illegal. They have been accused of fostering a \"cult-like\" mentality among their members.",

        "response": "Older generations, such as the Silent Generation (born 1928-1945), Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964), and Generation X (born 1965-1980), faced distinct challenges and advantages compared to current generations, including Millennials (born 1981-1996) and Generation Z (born 1997-2012). Here are some key differences:\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n1. **Economic uncertainty**: Older generations faced economic downturns, such as the Great Depression and stagflation, which had a lasting impact on their financial security and career prospects.\n2. **Limited education and job opportunities**: Prior to the 1960s, education and job opportunities were limited, especially for women and minorities. This led to fewer career choices and lower earning potential.\n3. **Social and cultural norms**: Older generations grew up during a time of social and cultural change, which often meant adapting to new norms and values, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the women's liberation movement.\n4. **Technological limitations**: Older generations had to adapt to new technologies, such as the internet and mobile phones, which were not as widespread or user-friendly as they are today.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1. **Stability and security**: Older generations often experienced a more stable and secure work environment, with longer job tenure and better benefits.\n2. **Stronger social connections**: Older generations were more likely to have strong social connections and community ties, which provided emotional support and a sense of belonging.\n3. **Less debt and financial stress**: Older generations were less likely to have significant student loan debt and credit card debt, which can be a significant source of financial stress.\n4. **More defined career paths**: Older generations often had more defined career paths and a clearer sense of what was expected of them in the workplace.\n\n**Evidence:**\n\n1. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Baby Boomers reported feeling financially secure, compared to 45% of Millennials.\n2. A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the median student loan debt for Baby Boomers was $0, compared to $31,300 for Millennials.\n3. A study by the Harvard Business Review found that older generations were more likely to have strong social connections and a sense of community, with 71% of Baby Boomers reporting that they had a \"best friend\" compared to 44% of Millennials.\n4. A report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that older generations had longer job tenure, with 47% of Baby Boomers having worked for the same employer for 10 years or more, compared to 24% of Millennials.\n\nIn conclusion, older generations faced distinct challenges and advantages compared to current generations. While they had to adapt to economic uncertainty, limited education and job opportunities, and social and cultural change, they also experienced stability and security, stronger social connections, less debt and financial stress, and more defined career paths.",

            "For much of the postwar 20th century, if you were a young white man with at least a high-school education, you had to try *not* to get a job that would fund at least a lower-middle-class lifestyle. If you had a college degree in *anything*, even English or Art History, you were pretty much guaranteed a lifetime of desk jobs, each higher-paying and more powerful than the last, with The Firm, which would then take care of you through retirement with a pension. If you came into The Firm with a Bachelors, it might actually pay your time *and your tuition* for a Masters. When you went home at the end of the night, work was generally over - there was no email. Calling someone at home was a big deal and used mostly for emergencies. (This era is largely where the perception that the unemployed are just lazy comes from. There really was a time when you had to be lazy to be unemployed.) Nowadays, you need to get into a good elementary school that will prepare you to work hard in middle school so you can take the right classes in high school to get into a good college in a handful of the \"right\" majors, and then maybe go to graduate school, to stand a *chance* of getting a good job if you're also a friendly/interesting person who interviews well.

            "In the US young people have the problem of a changing nature of labor and the contract between worker and corporation. In past few decades wages have not increased with respect to ~interest rates~ inflation, in many ways they have decreased. This means we get a larger number in terms of dollars from the companies we work for, but we receive far less value for our work. So we have to work more. We work for smaller firms generally, shops and retail, tinier operations that make unionizing and collective bargaining less viable strategies for supporting our labor's value. A major reason for the existence of unions was to combat the spreading de-humanization of work, which simply put took satisfaction out of labor and alienated people. Additionally, they helped support labor in national politics. By and large people born in the past 20 years will never join or support a union, and won't be able to offer each other support for their livelihoods. This means goods are slightly cheaper, but labor is cheaper still, so we have to work more to stay solvent. Gains in women's rights and expanded diversity have slightly offset the effects of wage stagnation, but the crisis of 2008 shows us that we won't get back to the state of the mid-90s labor. The minimum wages your parents worked for briefly as youths are the wages you will work for until you are middle-aged, when you briefly make more and then get fired and have to work for minimum wages again (on average).

You will change jobs many times in your lifetime as a replaceable cog in a variety of machines that don't care about you. Oh, and you won't be able to retire on the average person's wages. You'll get no pension, and once you are fired for being less productive than a computer the company you worked for will forget you ever existed.

Global competition is tough, especially since American kids aren't keeping up with math or science as well as countries such as China or Singapore. Back in the day, you didn't have to worry about kids pulling ahead you who live 5000 miles away. Today, they compete with you. Why choose you, when employers can hire someone in India to do the same thing for much less? Less manual intensive jobs are available today. Companies don't need so much manual labor today, as they did 30 years ago. If they do need a labor intensive job to get done, it is sent east to East Asia for cheap labor. This is true for things like manufacturing and assembly. More jobs are automated in general. You don't always need people to get the job done. You can get a computer to do the same thing. Why call up a travel agent when you can go to Priceline or Expedia? Self checkout lines? Basically what I'm saying is that there were more (good) employment opportunities back in the day. Being lazy today is worse than being lazy back then. You need to put in a lot more effort to live well today than our parents and grandparents had to.

            "When we talk about that we're talking about the post war generations. A few things happened in America that was completely unprecedented. One, most the the industrialized world was in ruin except for the United States, this led to a large number of high paying private manufacturing jobs. Two the United States vs. the Soviet Union made it necessary for large government expenditure and expansion, this also created jobs. Three, women retreated from the work force after the war creating more demand for labor. These three things made it extremely easy to find good paying work. Now, lets look at housing. Housing cost from post war until about 1975 rose, roughly, with inflation. In the mid 70s the price of housing started to outpace inflation, this has accelerated so that a house in 1970 that would have cost 100k(adjusted for inflation) would have cost 200k in 1990, and today that exact same house would run half a million. These are national numbers, there are certainly places in America where this isn't the case, but it's true in most places. Next is education. I'll keep this one easy. In 1960 it cost roughly $9500 in inflation adjusted dollars to attend an ivy league school. It now costs over $40,000. That's quadrupling of tuition, the price of books and the aforementioned housing has also gone up significantly more. Well, there's three factors. There's more, but you get the jist of it.",

Breast cancer culture, sometimes called pink ribbon culture, is the cultural outgrowth of breast cancer advocacy, the social movement that supports it, and the larger women's health movement.\nThe pink ribbon is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness, and in many countries, the month of October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Women in the USA make far more purchasing decisions than Men so it is not a stretch to think that buying power hasn't reached to charitable endeavors as well.

            "I'll say something other than the conspiracies (however much truth there may be) here. Awareness is so much more than making someone aware of beat cancers mere existence. Awareness is about knowing and recognizing the signs in yourself and others, so that the disease can be detected early, and thus be more easily treated. For example, I bet most people who have heard of breast cancer haven't heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It's a rare form of breast cancer that forms in sheets instead of lumps. By the time it's detectable as a misshapen breast, is usually already at stage 4. Another example is that men can and do get breast cancer. Most men don't realize this, and would have absolutely no idea how to monitor for it. That's another part of awareness: knowing who is at risk. Most people only know that lumps = breast cancer. But there are many kinds that manifest in different ways. Awareness helps (or should) people understand more about the disease, not just make them aware that it exists. This should be the case for most cancers, but breast cancer gained traction due to its prevalence in modern America, and organizations like SGK getting the word out. P.S. Try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when talking about breast cancer awareness. There are shady people trying to profit off it, sure, but there are also a lot of people out there who this cause is very important to, and are trying to help with nothing but the best intentions. My sisters and I are considering starting a charity for IBC awareness and research, in honor of our mother who died from it. We've already hosted a few fundraisers whose proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. There are people out there trying to help. I'm one of them.

Plenty of other companies over pay their CEOs and higher up while doing nothing for the community and saving no life's.

            "Seems like there are many cynics out here. It's true there are many parasitic organizations that capitalize on our charity and good will, but the fact is that breast cancer is one of the many cancers where death is preventable if caught in early stages. This is alongside cervical (get your pap smears at 21 ladies, and HPV vaccines for everyone), prostate for men (older men should do digital rectal exams), and of course lung (stop smoking). It's a little unfair to say that breast cancer is the only one getting awareness when all these other cancers are also getting attention. I think breast cancer was the first big movement because you are able to do a self-exam and that is empowering to women, so it is now the biggest (btw the main reliable screening tool is regular mammographies, so self-exams are a start, but not sufficient). Just to provide a scale of the problem, more than 50% (a half!) of women will develop a benign breast lesion. Fortunately most of these are not lethal and should not progress to a malignancy. More than 10% of women will develop a true malignancy, where your odds of survival are almost exponential the earlier you catch it. So it's kind of important to make it common knowledge how to find a lump in your breast, because there's a chance that it might kill you. That's not to deny the aforementioned parasitic organizations. I guess the best advice is find a good charity of your choice and ignore the bad ones, but don't hate on the movement as a whole because it is trying to make a difference for the American public.",

But now what do you do with the organization they built up? For something like breast cancer awareness, their mission is complete.

As you might be aware, most non-profit organizations have to divide their resources between administration and their cause. What you might not be aware of is that a lot of the administrative costs go toward finding more funding. Unless a non-profit has a stable stream of income from committed donors, grants, or an endowment, every non-profit is in constant pursuit of more sources of revenue. This often means hiring a professional grant writer and hosting some sort of open house or gala that informs and solicits donors. Even stable non-profits will probably be constantly pursuing more revenue to further their cause and expand their programs. The Komen Foundation decided to try a for-profit marketing campaign in order to get revenue. The people they hired advised them to have an ambitious advertising campaign with the justification that it would bring in a lot more revenue than it cost. It cost a ton of money but it was wildly successful, so they have kept it up and followed those strategies. The obvious downside is that an inappropriately large percentage of their budget goes toward marketing, which increases awareness but does not create a cure.

When you say you are raising awareness, people are more likely to be involved because their is not cost. 2: Saying you are raising awareness allows people who make no physical contribution to feel like they are doing something important, when all they are doing is sharing something on social media. They are \"raising awareness\" and pat themselves on the back, when really they are just being arm-chair activists. That is not a bad thing. You can't make concrete contributions to every cause, so promoting others is good, but too often I think people believe if they click 'like', they are doing something other than easing their conscience.",
            "Putting aside any ulterior motive companies that may or may not profit from, my literal eli5 would be: Reminding people of a problem that many people face may seem bad, but reminding them that they should check the area regularly, can help fix* the problem sooner. Like when adverts remind us to fill in tax returns, we all know about it but can easily ignore it. So being reminded will keep it in out minds to do it sooner. It also helps make it less scary for some people, knowing that their not alone and others that may not be in their situation can talk knowledgeably or aid helpfully. (*'fix' is subjective, but this is eli5. 'Not die' is best outcome of worst case)",
            "It's partly because of pandering. There are many types of cancer that affect both sexes that are more prevalent and deadlier than breast cancer but it's a way for people to show support for womens causes and so it gets a lot of attention. Prostate cancer is just as deadly and many men die from it each year yet very little is done about it from a fundraising perspective. This can be argued because it's a cancer that affects privileged men VS under privileged women. Supporting womens causes is seen as progressive. Supporting mens causes or equal right causes is seen as misogynistic to some. To put it another way, all the hype around breast cancer awareness is just a kind of reverse sexism.",
            "It's billions of dollars. Raising awareness comes down to three things: 1) collect more money 2) fly all over the world with rich accommodations at 5 star resorts, personal drivers, lavish meals all paid for by your donated dollars 3) suing anyone and everyone who uses a shade of pink too similiar (within 10 shades) of their own, or uses the word \"cure\" in anything.

Everyone knows what breast cancer is, but you're more likely to donate if its shoved in front of your face. Two things: Charities make money, they run a lot of things that give no money to actual research, but can still say they are donating to the cause of increasing awareness. This seems lame but is one of the reasons that \"awareness\" is talked about so much.",
            "Was developing a website once that wanted to include the breast cancer awareness pink branding mumbo jumbo. When we contacted them about involving them in the site they immediately began the discussion by saying there would legal action of we used it without their permission and to get their permission we had to guarantee $10,000.00 in donations each month. If donations didn't reach that level the company had to make up the balance. Shook my head and laughed, never spoke to them again. Felt very dirty dealing with them.",
            "Big cancer is one of the most profitable industries. They employ mostly volunteers, produce little in the means of ribbons, flyers, and shirts. Probably their biggest overhead is commercials and other advertising. The pink breast cancer ribbon campaign you're speaking of donates a very small percentage of their profits. I've read as little as 3%. It's not about perpetual awareness as much as it is perpetual profits. These \"charities\" should be audited quarterly and their giving should be made public.",
            "All cynicism aside, it's like most advertising. Does anyone not know about McDonalds or Pappa Johns at this point? No, but they need reminding to invest money in their products. Similarly, these \"awareness\" efforts are to promote a cause and ask you to invest money (donating to research or testing ideally) or effort (getting yourself tested) into the cause. As silly as the \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" was, there was a sharp rise in donations to ALS societies from that campaign.",
            "As with everything, it's all about money sadly. Also If I want to donate I will donate to an actual research facility, or to cancer patients themselves, not some for profit company. Plus everyone(in the us at least) knows about breast cancer in women. Since these campaigns only are about spreading \"Awareness\", they need to start spreading awareness about men with breast cancer. Which I've literally never heard and of the big companies bring up.",

            "Profits. Most organizations that \"raise awareness\" keep the money while donating about 1% of raised funds to actual research. Remember these companies do not care about a cure.

        "context": "Breast cancer awareness is an effort to raise awareness and reduce the stigma of breast cancer through education about screening, symptoms, and treatment. Supporters hope that greater knowledge will lead to earlier detection of breast cancer, which is associated with higher long-term survival rates, and that money raised for breast cancer will produce a reliable, permanent cure.\nBreast cancer advocacy and awareness efforts are a type of health advocacy. Breast cancer advocates raise funds and lobby for better care, more knowledge, and more patient empowerment. They may conduct educational campaigns or provide free or low-cost services.  Breast cancer culture, sometimes called pink ribbon culture, is the cultural outgrowth of breast cancer advocacy, the social movement that supports it, and the larger women's health movement.\nThe pink ribbon is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness, and in many countries, the month of October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Some national breast cancer organizations receive substantial financial support from corporate sponsorships.\nBreast cancer awareness campaigns have been criticized for minimizing the risks of screening programs, conflicts of interest, and a narrow focus of research funding on screening and existing treatments at the expense of prevention and new treatments.",
        "input": "Will a cake baked with milk expiring tomorrow also expire tomorrow, or does baking nullify the milk's expiration date? \n",
        "response": "What a delightful question!\n\nIn general, baking a cake with milk does not nullify the milk's expiration date. The expiration date on a food product, including milk, is a guideline set by the manufacturer to indicate the product's expected shelf life when stored properly under normal conditions.\n\nWhen you bake a cake with milk, the milk is incorporated into the batter and then cooked at high temperatures, which can affect its chemical composition and microbiological stability. However, this does not necessarily mean that the milk's expiration date is automatically extended or nullified.\n\nThe cake's shelf life will depend on various factors, including:\n\n1. The type of milk used: If you used ultra-pasteurized milk, which has a longer shelf life than regular milk, the cake may have a longer shelf life as well.\n2. Storage conditions: If the cake is stored in a cool, dry place, it may last longer than if it's stored at room temperature or in a humid environment.\n3. Handling and preparation: If the cake is handled and stored properly, it may last longer than if it's exposed to contamination or moisture.\n4. Recipe and ingredients: The type of recipe, ingredients, and cooking methods used can also affect the cake's shelf life.\n\nIn the case of a cake baked with milk expiring tomorrow, it's likely that the cake will still have a relatively short shelf life, possibly within a day or two, depending on the factors mentioned above. However, it's always best to check the cake's appearance, texture, and smell before consuming it to ensure it's still safe and fresh.\n\nSo, to answer your question, baking a cake with milk expiring tomorrow does not necessarily mean the cake will also expire tomorrow. The cake's shelf life will depend on various factors, and it's always important to follow proper food safety guidelines when consuming baked goods.",
        "gold_answer": [
            "The expiration date from the milk is no longer relevant. Your cake will have the same shelf regardless of whether you used milk expiring tomorrow, or milk expiring much later, because you have killed all the bacteria that were going to make the milk spoil.",
            "I worked at a food production facility and it's cool how much effort went into knowing the answers to this type of question. Every ingredient in a product that ends up for sale is considered and chosen for that recipe based on freshness dates. If certain ingredients are not as fresh then the 'sell by' date is changed. Potato salad with all fresh ingredients gets, say, three days on the shelf before the mayo goes off. That's basically universal, so extended shelf life means added salts, maybe sugar or vinegar but usually salt. So if your local deli has takeout potato salad and they say it's good for 2 days refrigerated and Wal-Mart has a tub of it but it's good for 6 days and we can assume similar ingredients ( they don't have magic mayo ) then it's a guarantee the extra 4 days come from the massive amount of added salt.",
            "There are a few different dates that get put on food, and they have different meanings. **Sell by** - mostly meaningless to consumers. A note for the store to discard the food after this date, but it's often a week or more before the food goes bad. Ignore this date, or add a week to it. Your milk probably has this date on it. **Best before** - a note for the customer. Quality can't be 100% guaranteed after this date, so you can't sue if it's not up to par, but it's still edible. **Use by** - this is a real one, but it only means quality may degrade after this date. If it smells okay, it's likely still safe. However, all of the above applies to ***unopened*** food. Once you open it, you introduce bacteria and humidity, and if you don't store it properly the date on the package doesn't matter. There are different ways food goes \"bad\" once it's opened: - **Stale/dry:** The flavor or texture is changed by the air. It doesn't taste the best, but it's not bad for you. - **Rancid:** Oils go bad. Some oils are prone to going bad from oxygen, heat, and light. Not only do they taste and smell bad, but they can chemically harm your body. - **Contaminated:** Bacteria grow when there's water or moisture. The bacteria can make you sick, and many bacteria (like botulism) make toxic wastes. Cooking it well kills the bacteria, but cooking won't get rid of the toxins. - **Moldy:** Fungus grows when there's moisture. If you see fuzzy mold or weird colors *anywhere* on the food, it's everywhere in the food. Throw it out. Now, back to the milk. The date on the carton is likely the \"sell by\" date, not an expiration date. Once it's home, add a week to get a better expiry date. Regardless of the date, if you haven't opened it yet, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. If you opened it in the past week and kept it in the fridge, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. It's been in the fridge open for more than a week... bacteria may have gotten in. Pour a bit into a cup and give it a smell. Your nose is good at detecting when something is off. **If it smells ok, it's probably good to cook with.** Cooking will kill off any bacteria and reset the expiration date. Cooking will likely fix stale or dry food too. You can put stale tortilla chips in the oven and they'll be good as new. You can cook with milk beyond its date if it smells fine. **If it looks or smells weird or gross, don't cook with it.** Cooking can kill bacteria, but it can't get rid of the toxic wastes from the bacteria or fungus, and it can't fix any rancid oils. However, you should know that if you're immune system is suppressed (old, very young, pregnant, or otherwise vulnerable to infection) then you should definitely keep to the printed \"use by\" dates and don't eat things after a few hours at room temperature or a few days in the fridge. This stuff may be lightly contaminated but still safe for most people, but it may be dangerous if your immune system can't handle the extra bacteria. You can still cook with it if you cook it thoroughly, but just be cautious.",
            "Somewhere in-between. The milk is no longer plain milk, it has combined with other ingredients in new combinations, and been cooked (which kills bacteria).
