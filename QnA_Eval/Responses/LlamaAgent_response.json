The movie follows private investigator Matthew Scudder, played by Liam Neeson, as he takes on a case to find the kidnappers of a young boy. The film's atmospheric and suspenseful tone is largely due to its filming location, which adds to the overall sense of tension and foreboding.\n\nThe movie was primarily filmed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with some scenes shot in New York City. Montreal's historic and atmospheric neighborhoods, such as Old Montreal and the Plateau Mont-Royal, provided the perfect backdrop for the film's dark and gritty tone. The city's architecture, with its mix of old and new buildings, added to the sense of unease and tension that permeates the movie.\n\nOne of the most notable filming locations in the movie is the iconic Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Cemetery, which serves as the setting for many of the film's most intense and suspenseful scenes. The cemetery's crumbling headstones and overgrown vegetation create a sense of decay and neglect, perfectly capturing the mood and atmosphere of the film.\n\nThe film's use of Montreal's diverse neighborhoods and landmarks also adds to its sense of realism.

Among the pioneers of this movement was American composer Steve Reich, born on October 3, 1937, in New York City. Reich's innovative approach to music has had a profound impact on the development of contemporary classical music.\n\nReich's early work was influenced by the avant-garde and experimental music of the 1950s and 1960s. He studied at Cornell University and later at the Juilliard School, where he was exposed to the works of Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez. These influences, combined with his own fascination with African and Asian music, laid the foundation for his unique minimalist style.\n\nReich's breakthrough piece, \"It's Gonna Rain\" (1965), marked the beginning of his minimalist period. This work, featuring a repeating pattern of spoken words and a simple melody, showcased his use of phasing, a technique where two or more identical patterns are played simultaneously, but with a slight delay. This created a hypnotic effect, characteristic of Reich's music.\n\nIn the following years, Reich continued to push the boundaries of minimalism with compositions such as \"Piano Phase\" (1967) and \"Music for 18 Musicians\" (1976).

In this article, we'll delve into the reasons behind this phenomenon, exploring the science behind bloodshot eyes after cannabis use.\n\n**The Role of THC**\n\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, plays a significant role in the development of bloodshot eyes.

This move marked a significant escalation of World War II, as the United States, which had previously maintained a policy of neutrality, was now drawn into the conflict.\n\nThe decision to declare war on the United States was made by Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Hitler had been planning to declare war on the United States for some time, as he believed that the country's entry into the war would weaken the British Empire and allow Germany to focus on its own military campaigns.\n\nThe declaration of war was announced in a radio broadcast by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, who stated that Germany was forced to take action against the United States due to its \"unprovoked\" attack on Japan. The broadcast also accused the United States of being a \"warmonger\" and claimed that Germany was fighting a \"war of self-defense\" against the Allied powers.\n\nThe declaration of war on the United States was met with widespread outrage and shock in the country. The American public was still reeling from the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and the news of Germany's declaration of war only added to the sense of shock and anger.\n\nIn response to the declaration of war, the United States Congress passed a joint resolution on Dece",

Millard's father had been a difficult and abusive man, and his passing left Millard feeling lost and uncertain about his faith. As he grappled with these emotions, Millard began to write a song that would eventually become \"I Can Only Imagine.\"\n\nThe song's lyrics are a poignant and introspective reflection on what it will be like to stand before God in heaven. Millard sings about the joy and wonder of being reunited with loved ones who have passed away, and the hope and peace that comes from knowing that God is waiting for him. The song's chorus, \"I can only imagine what it will be like / When I walk by your side,\" is a powerful expression of faith and trust in God's presence.\n\n\"I Can Only Imagine\" was released as a single in 2001 and quickly became a hit, reaching the top of the Christian music charts and staying there for several weeks.

He exploited deep-seated fears and resentments among the German people, particularly towards the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed harsh penalties on Germany after the war.

I am pretty sure I have seen footage at least once a day. Third, I have never been in a place where people are so quick to defend a person being verbally or physically attacked by another person. On the train I have seen many altercations (verbal) that generally ends with the asshole being called out by at least two other people (sometimes the entire train car gets pissed). So they aren't generally ones to stand by and let that shit happen. That being said it has caused some issues. In Germany it is illegal to argue facts of the Holocaust in public. The official story has not changed in a long time even with new data and facts present. Historians can lose their jobs or be arrested for trying to argue on the side of truth. So, there is that. It has also made racism a very difficult thing to talk about. No one wants to talk about the fact that German citizens with Turkish parents are still treated like subcitizens ....but they are. Lastly, this does not mean that Germans don't have a sense of humor about Hitler. I would, however, suggest that if you crack a Hitler or Holocaust related joke that you know the person you are talking to very well and refrain from doing so in public. People are very vigilant when it comes to anything Nazi related. Graffiti is covered quickly after the police are contacted. Edit: to be clear Germans dislike Hitler. There is no type of worship on the part of the German people..some even still feel guilty. Some don't like joking about him.

If they are Medicare recipients, they sort of have a point, but their point would be saying \"Some of our future planned entitlement money is being used as an entitlement for another group.\" Overall, for the average American, Obamacare doesn't shift much money around from what they pay or to where it goes.",
            "An economist would say healthcare has a [positive externality]( URL_0 ). You can look at it like this: * The amount a person buys of a good (eg doctor visits) is based on how many they want and how much they can afford. This is referred to as the **private benefit**. * There are some things you can buy that make everyone better off. For example: going to the doctor every time you are sick will make you less likely to make other people sick. This is referred to as a **public benefit**. * Because only the private benefit is taken into account when someone is buying something, people buy less of a good than is **socially optimal** (private benefit + public benefit) * Governments give money to people so that they will buy more of these goods in order to make everyone else feel better (ie get closer to the socially optimal amount of consumption). Positive/Negative externalities are the driving force behind a lot of government policy. Edit: Formatting",

I don't understand why it is such a big deal in the USA. Yes, government tax revenue pays for healthcare. The rest of us in the first world have been doing this for decades. Ask whether Government should provide free schooling for those same freeloading poor people? And free roads too for those too poor to use private toll roads?

Despite his desire to return to the United States, Snowden has been unable to do so due to the charges filed against him and the political climate surrounding his case.\n\nIn 2013, the United States government charged Snowden with espionage, theft of government property, and unauthorized communication of national defense information. The charges carried a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. However, Snowden has maintained that he acted in the public interest and that his actions were necessary to expose the government's illegal surveillance programs.\n\nOne of the main reasons Snowden has been unable to return to the United States is that he would likely face a lengthy and potentially unfair trial. The government has accused Snowden of being a traitor and has sought to portray him as a dangerous individual who put national security at risk. This has led to a highly politicized and sensationalized media coverage of his case, which has made it difficult for Snowden to receive a fair trial.\n\nFurthermore, Snowden has expressed concerns about the political climate surrounding his case. He has stated that he believes the government is seeking to punish him for his actions, rather than holding him accountable for any alleged wrongdoing. This has led to concerns about the fairness ",

            "[In his own words]( URL_0 ):  >  A number of detractors have suggested that if Snowden, who disclosed controversial top-secret N.S.A. programs to reporters, truly wanted to commit an act of civil disobedience for reasons of conscience, then he should have faced the legal consequences, making his case to the American public while standing trial at home.  >  When I asked why he didn’t take this route, Snowden said that because of the way national-security laws have been interpreted since September 11, 2001, he believed that the government had deprived him, and other whistle-blowers, of ever having the opportunity to make their cases in this time-honored tradition. Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, “It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.”)  >  Snowden said that he would “love” to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, “I have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they’re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I’m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so. But they’ve declined.”  >  Instead, Snowden said, “They want to use special procedures. They want a closed court. They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.” So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn't believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a \"show\" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently.",
            "No one has mentioned this yet or at least not very succinctly: The crime he is accused of (Violating the Espionage Act of 1917) doesn't allow you to defend yourself and the Supreme court has previously ruled this is not a violation of free speech. I feel like more people need to know that.",
            "The Supreme Court wouldn't need to get involved here. ~~They generally only get involved in constitutional issues (that is, interpreting the United States Constitution).~~ Snowden committed a crime, there's no two ways about it. What he did may or may not have been morally or ethically right or wrong, but under current law, he committed a crime. Even if SCOTUS finds what the NSA did to be illegal, it still wouldn't exonerate him of his crime.",
            "He could, but he's afraid that he would lose. Which is reasonable, seeing as he almost certainly would. Even *if* we make the incredibly generous assumption that there's no corruption in the American government, and that there's no incentive to protect the NSA, Snowden still committed a crime. Someone else doing something illegal doesn't usually give you the right to also do something illegal. So it's entirely possible that while the NSA will be penalized for their actions, so will Snowden. And that's really the best case scenario, seeing as there *is* likely incentive for the government to protect the NSA. Or worse, there might be actual *justification* for the NSA's actions, which will seriously hurt any of Snowden's defenses. So even if he gets a fair trial he'll probably be found guilty, and it's certainly a reasonable fear that he wouldn't get a fair trial. Coming back is really a no-win scenario for him.",

If you look at what Snowden released the gist of it is that the U.S. security apparatus (NSA in this case) is spying on everyone in the world including American citizens (without a wire tap warrant signed by a judge, aka due process) and foreign heads of state ( a breach of diplomatic protocol). Snowden let the public know what was going on. The powers that be call this treason and would like to do to him what was done to the Rosenbergs. Up to this point the government sounds both reasonable and consistent. Later, however, we find out that the Chinese are doing the same thing, as are the Brits, the Russians, and basically any country that bothers to do so is in fact doing so.

If someone like Snowden ever made it to trial, it would not be the kind of trial you see on TV. In fact, it would probably be worst and more on-sided than Hussein's trial, and he was a monster.",
            "I just thought of something. Couldn't the defense argue that Snowden cannot be charged with violating the Espionage Act as he leaked the classified documents to Wikileaks, which is not a hostile government but closer to a corporation? Yeah he leaked classified information, but didn't actually hand it over to Russia so it isn't actually treason."

            "Well Billy, it's like this... When you're young, being an adult seems like a really great thing. You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there's all that naughty stuff you're not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what \"they want to be when they grow up\". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don't really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You've got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you've got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You've also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you've got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don't pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you're not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you've never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you're going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it's going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can't afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there's all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won't, but... there's a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you're not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you've ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won't ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don't have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it's not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn't make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don't have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It's a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren't so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve. That's part of why people are depressed, Billy. And that's all without mentioning the wars and the suffering and the poverty in countries other than our own, places we would like to help because they're people just like us... but we're too busy struggling to get by ourselves, to really help them as much as we'd like. Grown up life is hard, Billy. I'm sorry.",

About the only thing you can tell a 5 year old is that a person suffering from depression has a brain that is telling them to be depressed. Sometimes medications help to make it harder for the brain to tell them to be depressed. That said, there are basically two types of depression, there is situational depression (and this usually has a large component of sadness with it) and there is chronic depression which is not really a \"sadness\" as much as a feeling of apathy and a lack of motivation.

Depending on the balance of the good and the bad, you'll say you had a good, or a bad day. Now imagine that I selectively dull your capacity to feel the good parts of the day.

But have you ever wondered how overtime works and why companies offer it? In this article, we'll delve into the world of overtime, exploring its benefits, profitability, and the reasons behind its widespread adoption.\n\n**How Overtime Works**\n\nOvertime is typically paid at a rate higher than an employee's regular hourly wage, usually 1.5 to 2 times their regular rate. This premium pay is designed to compensate employees for their extra work, ensuring they receive fair compensation for their extended hours. In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay non-exempt employees overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek.\n\n**Why Companies Offer Overtime**\n\nOffering overtime can be a win-win for both employees and employers. For employees, overtime provides additional income, which can be especially beneficial during periods of financial uncertainty or when seeking to supplement their primary income. For companies, overtime can be a cost-effective way to meet increased demands or complete projects without having to hire additional staff.

Secondary costs like training, benefit, uniforms, insurance, etc cost money and the company has likely done the math and determined that paying staff overtime is cheaper in the long run then hiring more staff.

        "context": "The phenomenon of \"selfie cameras\" flipping a picture, while rear cameras do not, is a common observation among smartphone users. But have you ever wondered why this is the case? The answer lies in the design and functionality of these cameras.\n\nHistorically, the first camera phones were equipped with a single camera, usually located on the back of the device. This was due to the limited technology and design constraints of the time. However, with the advent of front-facing cameras, also known as \"selfie cameras,\" the need for a separate camera on the front of the device arose.\n\nThe primary reason for flipping the picture taken by the selfie camera is to correct the orientation of the image. When taking a selfie, the camera is positioned in a way that the subject (the user) is facing the camera, whereas the camera itself is facing away from the subject. This creates an issue with the image orientation, as the camera is capturing the subject from a different angle than the typical landscape or portrait orientation.\n\nTo address this issue, smartphone manufacturers implemented a feature called \"mirror flipping\" or \"image flipping.\" This feature flips the image taken by the selfie camera, effectively correcting the orientation and presenting the image in the correct orientation for viewing.\n\nIn contrast, rear cameras do not require this correction, as they are typically positioned to capture images in the standard landscape or portrait orientation.

This landmark legislation aimed to reduce the incidence of child abuse and promote a culture of non-violence in families.\n\n**Historical Context**\n\nPrior to the introduction of the Anti-Smacking Law, Section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961 allowed parents to use \"reasonable force\" to discipline their children.

This tiny being is the result of a complex process involving the fusion of a sperm and an egg cell. However, the embryo's journey doesn't end with conception. It has to implant itself into the lining of the uterus, a process known as implantation, which is a crucial step in ensuring a successful pregnancy.\n\n**When Does Implantation Occur?**\n\nImplantation typically takes place 6-10 days after fertilization, when the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage. At this point, the embryo consists of around 100-200 cells and has developed a protective outer layer called the trophectoderm. The blastocyst begins to travel down the fallopian tube and into the uterus, where it will implant itself into the uterine lining.\n\n**The Implantation Process**\n\nThe implantation process is a delicate and intricate dance between the embryo and the uterine lining. The blastocyst uses specialized cells called trophoblasts to attach itself to the uterine lining, which is rich in blood vessels and nutrients. The trophoblasts secrete enzymes that help break down the uterine lining, allowing the embryo to burrow deeper and establish a secure attachment.\n\n**Why Is Implantation Important?**\n\nImplantation is a critical step in ensuring a successful pregnancy.

        "context": "The Fear of Unvaccinated Children: Separating Fact from Fiction\n\nThe debate surrounding vaccination has been a contentious issue for decades, with many parents expressing concern about the potential risks of vaccinating their children. One common misconception is that if a child is vaccinated, they are completely immune to contracting the illness. However, this is not entirely accurate. In this article, we will explore the reasons why some parents become upset when an unvaccinated child is around their vaccinated child, and what it means for their child's health.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to understand that vaccines do not provide 100% immunity against a particular disease. While vaccines significantly reduce the risk of contracting an illness, they are not foolproof. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), even vaccinated individuals can still contract a disease, although the risk is much lower.\n\nWhen an unvaccinated child is around a vaccinated child, there is a risk of transmission. This is because the unvaccinated child may still be carrying the disease, even if they are not showing symptoms. In some cases, the unvaccinated child may be a carrier of the disease, meaning they are infected but not showing symptoms. This is known as asymptomatic transmission.\n\nThe concern for parents of vaccinated children is that their child may still contract the disease, even if they have been vaccinated. This is because the vaccine may not provide complete immu",

            "**Not everyone can be or is vaccinated** So, say you have a 4 month old child. That child is not inoculated against measles, because you don't get that vaccine until 12 months. However, that child can still get the measles. Similarly, say you have a kid who has been otherwise sickly, or is one of the rare, but not unheard of kids for whom the vaccine doesn't take. Or say you're an old person whose immune system has simply weakened overall. In any of these cases, the unvaccinated child is a danger.",
            "There is also the chance of enough un-vaccinated people acting as a \"breeding chamber\" for the illness, allowing it to mutate and infect vaccinated people. Considering the long duration before a new vaccine can be made and given out, this is a pretty damnable risk.",

            "Vaccinations are not 100% effective, so someone who is vaccinated still may get the disease. As well, babies and other people who cannot be vaccinated are at risk of being infected by an unvaccinated child (or by a child who was vaccinated but who is still a carrier and who was infected by an unvaccinated child or adult.)",
            "*There are some people who are allergic to ingredients in vaccines and can't get some of them. *There are also people who are immuno-compromised in some way (perhaps from chemotherapy or from HIV), and they can't get vaccines. *Some infants aren't old enough for some vaccines. *There are some vaccines that can take multiple doses to be effective. For example, the whooping cough vaccine (DTAP), only protects about 60% of infants after the first dose. It isn't until after the 3rd or 4th dose (at about 12 months old) that almost all vaccinated babies are fully immune to whooping cough. In all of the above examples, those people rely on the immunity of those around them. When the vaccination rate in a community drops, it allows preventable diseases to spread if introduced. That's why people who can get vaccinated but don't put their entire community at risk.",
            "No, because vaccinations aren't 100% effective. So even if you vaccinate your child, there's like a 2% chance that, if exposed to a pathogen, they can still become infected. The best defense against this is everyone vaccinating their child. This is not to mention those children that have compromised immune systems and cannot receive vaccines."

Meanwhile, streaming HD video online requires a reliable internet connection and high bandwidth. This seeming paradox has sparked curiosity among tech enthusiasts and ordinary viewers alike. In this article, we'll delve into the world of over-the-air broadcasting and explore the reasons behind this disparity.\n\nOver-the-Air Broadcasting: A Brief History\n\nThe concept of over-the-air broadcasting dates back to the early 20th century, when radio signals were transmitted using amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) techniques. As television technology evolved, broadcasting companies began using radio frequencies (RF) to transmit TV signals to the public. In the 1990s, the introduction of digital television (DTV) enabled the transmission of high-quality video and audio signals, paving the way for modern over-the-air broadcasting.\n\nKey Factors Contributing to Seamless HD TV Transmission\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the ability of HD TV signals to be transmitted over the air without buffering or loading:\n\n1. **Frequency Bandwidth**: TV broadcasting uses a specific frequency band, typically between 54 MHz and 862 MHz, which is allocated by regulatory bodies. This frequency band ",

            " >  Curious how hd tv is easily sent over the air but hd video streaming online takes high bandwidth and a good internet connection. A television broadcast is like talking into a loudspeaker system to address an entire stadium. Video streaming online is like holding an individual conversation with every person in the stadium simultaneously.",
            "There is some buffering when receiving video OTA, the buffering happens immediately after tuning. With OTA the stream is always there, and it's always on, all you have to do is grab the first decipherable packet and start deciding, you know the next one will be along immediately because it's guaranteed, furthermore if you drop a packet there is nothing you can do about it, so the stream is encoded to be able to continue with minimum disruption but obvious glitches. With internet streams the computer fetches a bunch of data because it doesn't know for sure when the next packet is arriving, the connection might at any moment stop delivering packets for a few moments, so you have to have sufficient data available to ride the gap and this riding the gap /can/ be invisible if you don't run out of buffer, so streaming video will pause and recontinue from the same location because in some cases you can do it without the user noticing. Why the gaps happen is because the internet is a series of pipes of different diameter.... the wire from your house to the exchange can handle less traffic than the wire from the exchange upstream, so obviously when you request a big file somebody has to rate limit the transfer because the internet itself isn't going to hold huge files in transit, the way that any part of the network shows it's over capacity is to randomly not transmit a packet - so YouTube thinks it's sent you the next instalment, but you never receive it, think of what this would do to a game of chess by post, how do you know that your move has been lost in the post? The answer is to resend your last move if you don't get a timely response, but this delay when viewing video causes skips. The most obvious restriction you can ease is the one between yourself and the exchange, buying fast internet means less dropped packets which means less stalls and a faster refill of your video buffer.",
            "Adding on to the other excellent answers here, I will add that traffic and contention are an issue. You are probably aware about how sometimes Internet traffic can get slower based on how many people are using it. This is a major cause of buffering with video streaming, because you're sharing almost the entire length of the connection with many other people. When you watch HD TV over the air, this isn't a concern. Nobody else is using that bandwidth. It's all 100% reserved for the television station. It's a specific frequency range that is legally reserved for them -- so they have all that bandwidth, every hour of the day, every day of the week. Also, it's broadcast, so your TV doesn't have to interact with the source of the transmission -- just pick up the signal and show it. This means that it doesn't matter if one person is watching it or a million. The full signal gets to you."

This phenomenon is not unique to individuals, as research suggests that emotions are indeed more intense right before bed. But why does this happen?\n\n**The Role of Cortisol and Adrenaline**\n\nOne key factor contributing to the amplification of emotions before bed is the fluctuation of cortisol and adrenaline levels. Cortisol, often referred to as the \"stress hormone,\" is typically highest in the morning and gradually decreases throughout the day. However, as bedtime approaches, cortisol levels can experience a sudden surge, causing feelings of anxiety, restlessness, and heightened emotions.\n\nAdrenaline, on the other hand, is often associated with the \"fight or flight\" response. As the body prepares for sleep, adrenaline levels typically decrease, allowing the body to relax and unwind. However, if cortisol levels remain elevated, adrenaline can become overactive, leading to increased emotional reactivity and sensitivity.\n\n**The Impact of Sleep Deprivation**\n\nSleep deprivation is another significant factor in the amplification of emotions before bed.

What am I going to do with all this space now? If it wasn't a mansion, would my house have been less expensive?\" During sleep, it is believed that memories formed during the day are being stored away into long term memory. Dreams are believed to be the signals that the brain picks up on and erroneously interprets as perception during this process. It seems as though stressful memories are more likely remembered, so you know how to deal with stress later, and dreams are accidentally a way for you to practice dealing with stress without the risk of failure. Also, scientists performed experiments with people falling asleep hooked up to brain scanners. During early stages of sleep, they were woken up, but they reported that they didn't feel like they even began to fall asleep at all. This suggests that awake/asleep is more like a sliding scale, and we don't always know how conscious we are. Therefore, when you try to fall asleep, your brain is probably already preparing to store away stressful memories and have a dream.",

So the country loses less money paying for exports, and makes more money selling its now cheaper exports. They can also create new money to pay for government spending, creating employment and pulling the country back onto its feet. If there is only one currency, a country can't do this.

This trope has become a staple in crime dramas and thrillers, but have you ever wondered why the cop does this? The answer lies in a combination of psychological manipulation, practicality, and historical context.\n\nIn the early days of detective work, police officers would often use their badge and gun as a symbol of authority to intimidate suspects into cooperating. This tactic, known as \"badge and gun,\" was meant to establish the officer's credibility and demonstrate their ability to enforce the law. By placing these items on the table, the officer is, in effect, saying, \"I'm here to get to the truth, and I have the power to make it happen.\"\n\nHowever, this approach has evolved over time. Modern police training emphasizes the importance of building rapport and establishing trust with suspects. Instead of relying solely on intimidation, detectives now use their badge and gun as a way to signal that they are there to help, rather than harm. By placing these items on the table, the officer is, in a sense, saying, \"I'm here to listen and help you, and I have the authority to do so.\"\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, the placement of the badge and gun on the table can also be seen as a form of nonverbal communication. It's a way for the officer to convey their intentions and establish a sense of control without resorting to aggressive language",

Putting your gun on the table where the other person can see it can easily be a threat, a visible reminder of your willingness or authorization to use force. Your badge is an actual status symbol, and most places have laws regarding things like impeding an investigation, or just plain old social stigma, and putting your badge on the table can be used as a reminder of such. Alternatively as the others have mentioned it can also be viewed as them stepping outside their duties, such as when they hand their gun and badge to someone else to engage in a fistfight with someone. Or maybe the screenwriter or director thought it would be cool. They do that a lot.",

In this article, we will delve into the world of Mexican Train, exploring the history of the game, the rules, and the number of dominoes needed to play.\n\n**A Brief History of Mexican Train**\n\nMexican Train, also known as Mexican Train Dominoes, is a variation of the classic domino game. The game originated in the United States in the early 20th century, specifically in the Mexican-American border region. It is believed to have evolved from the traditional Spanish domino game, Truco, which was brought to the Americas by Spanish colonizers.\n\n**The Rules of Mexican Train**\n\nTo play Mexican Train, you will need a set of dominoes with a specific number of tiles. The game is played with 2-5 players, and the objective is to be the first player to lay down all of your dominoes. Each player starts with a hand of dominoes, and the game begins with the player who has the highest double domino.\n\nThe game is played in rounds, with each player taking turns laying down dominoes that match the tiles already played. The player who lays down the most dominoes in a round earns points, and the game continues until one player has laid down all of their dominoes.\n\n**The Number of Dominoes Needed*",

However, for many passengers, the experience of flying in an airplane is surprisingly calm and uneventful. So, why don't we feel like we're going fast when, in fact, we're traveling at incredible velocities?\n\nOne major reason is the concept of perspective. When you're on the ground, you're used to seeing the world at a relatively slow pace. You walk, drive, or bike at speeds that are measured in miles per hour, not thousands of miles per hour. This makes it difficult to comprehend the sheer speed at which an airplane is moving. To put it into perspective, a commercial airliner typically cruises at around 915 km/h (567 mph), which is roughly the same speed as a high-speed train.\n\nAnother factor is the sensation of acceleration. When you're in an airplane, you don't feel the sudden jolt of acceleration that you would when accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in a car. This is because airplanes take off and land at a much slower rate, which makes the experience feel more gradual and less intense. Additionally, the smooth ride and lack of turbulence also contribute to a sense of calmness, making it difficult to feel like you're moving at high speeds.\n\nThe design of the airplane itself also plays a significant role in the illusion of speed. Modern commercial airliners are designed to be e",

        "response": "The concept of perspective and the sensation of acceleration both contribute to the illusion of speed, as our brains are not accustomed to seeing the world at such high velocities and the gradual takeoff and landing process makes the experience feel less intense.",
        "gold_answer": [
            "There aren't any forces acting on your body that would make you feel that way, except for when you are accelerating to/from that speed. Every part of the airplane -- your seat, the floor, the air in the cabin -- is moving at the same speed as you are, so there is no way for your body to tell.",
            "The Earth is hurtling through the air at many times that speed. We feel acceleration and deceleration, a change in speed, and you definitely feel the acceleration for the first 20 minutes of the flight or so as you take off and ascend. That's why you stay in your seat! Your seat is attached to the plane so it's *pushing* you up to the speed. They get to that speed gradually so it's not too uncomfortable. But once you're at cruising speed and altitude, everything in the plane is moving at the same speed as the plane, so it's like your not moving at all. Speed is relative.",
            "The human body is not great at sensing speed in general, only acceleration. We have a bunch of senses that all work together to let us know when we're changing speed or direction, but we have to rely on context clues to get a sense of constant speed. The next time you're in a car (as a passenger) close your eyes while the driver is going a constant speed on a straight road. You'll notice that it won't feel different from sitting in a parked car. Your sense of speed in a car is largely dependent on seeing objects in the distance and seeing how you move relative to those objects. When you're in a plane, you don't get that kind of feedback. Even with a window seat, objects are so far away that we don't have a good concept of how fast we're traveling. When you're landing and taking off, you start to gain a sense of speed.",

            "You and the air inside the craft all accelerate with the aircraft. As long as the aircraft maintains a relatively steady speed, there are no forces acting on you that would indicate you are travelling fast. Then looking out the window at altitude, objects on the ground are so distant that you don't have a good reference to know how fast you are travelling. The best time to see how fast you are travelling as at takeoff and landing when you have a better reference as to your speed with objects on the ground.",
            "Because you don't feel velocity. You could be going a million miles an hour and you wouldn't know it. What you feel is acceleration, a change in velocity. On an ordinary plane flight, this occurs at the beginning (during takeoff) and at the end (during landing). You also feel it when the plane changes direction, which also requires a chance in velocity.",
            "Speed doesn't create a force - acceleration creates a force. That's also the reason why you don't feel the force of the earth rotating on its axis, or revolving around the sun at 30 km/second. What creates a force is a *change* in speed, which is what acceleration is. Picture yourself in a stopped car. You're going 0 miles an hour. Do you feel any forces? Not really, you're sitting still, things are good. Now imagine you slam on the gas pedal, going up to 60 mph. Now you feel a *force* because your speed is changing - your body is pressed backwards against the seat by that force. Now you hit 60 and you ease off the gas, maintaining a nice freeway speed. Do you feel any force while you're on the freeway? No, you feel just about the same as you did parked - if you opened a window you could feel the air moving, but inside of your car, everything is just the same as if you were going 0. Except now, slam on the brakes. You're decelerating and changing speed - a force pushes you forward, straining against the seatbelt. Once you hit 0, that force is gone. An airplane works the same way - you accelerate up to 600 mph slowly, so that the force isn't too overwhelming, but once you hit that speed and stop accelerating, it feels just the same as being still on the ground. Aside from any bumps or turbulence, which (just like in a car) change your acceleration by a little bit and affect you as forces.",
            "In an airplane, you don't have much of a frame of reference. The cabin is usually sealed off, so you don't experience the sensation of plane moving through air. Planes try to keep a pretty steady path. Which means you experience few forces due to acceleration once away from the airport. Planes fly pretty high off the ground. If you look out the window, you might be able to make out a few houses or cars at the ground level, moving pretty slowly across your massive plane of view. Their movement means nothing to you, thousands of feet above the ground or any other stationary object."

The outermost layer is the crust, which varies in thickness from 5-70 kilometers. As we dig deeper, we would encounter the mantle, a thick layer of hot, viscous rock that makes up about 84% of the Earth's volume.

            "What would happen to the Earth? Probably nothing. If you made an instantaneous hole through the Earth and it wasn't being supported by anything, gravity would cause the solid core to fill the space immediately. The mantle will also fill in immediately. It would be like asking what would happen if you drilled a hole in the ocean. There might be a small earthquake that we can detect but that's about it. I'm not sure what will happen to the crust. Either you would have a very deep hole with a lava plug at the bottom, or a volcano. The earth has thousands of them, and the man made ones will probably be smaller than most, as it won't be over a hot spot or along a plate boundary. It would probably leak lava for a few days or weeks then stop and become extinct. Nothing that would affect very many people. If you could some how shield your hole to keep it form collapsing, nothing would still happen. The hole is too small and earth is too big. Gravity has to do with the mass of the planet, and the mass wouldn't change, or change by much, depending on what you did with the material in the hole, piled it up or simply disappeared it. The magnetic field also wouldn't be affected. Your hole is too small. If you had a hole a couple hundred miles across, you might get some of the apocalyptic effects you are looking for, but for a smaller hole, even one a mile wide, nothing exciting would happen.",
            "Simple answer: a perfect and in-destructible hole all the way to the core would start to spew hot liquified material through it. The gravity force on the outer layers would put pressure on the core which would force material through the hole. Edit1: I'm correcting myself based on the comments I have received. Edit1: The material might cool before it reaches the surface. That answer depends on the design of the hole. Edit1: Assuming the material did not solidify, the material would flow until is approximately reaches the surface. Once it gets close to the surface, the weight of the material in the column (hole) would balance out the gravitational pressure. There might be a bit of spew due to the momentum of the material. Since the core is denser than the rest of earth, on average, the material level would settle below earth's average surface. Edit1: I do not know if there is a place on earth where the surface is so far below the average that spewing core-material could happen. I would speculate something in the deepest trenches of the sea but that may not be the \"deepest\" place in this case. Since the earth diameter is smallest pole-to-pole then that might be \"deepest.\" Edit1: ~~Whether the material cools and seals the hole before raining death upon the planet is beyond me but I will speculate:~~ Edit1: ~~I would guess that, since the earth we still exist, then the hole would cool and seal up before raining massive destruction upon us. But...if the hole is insulated then there might be unimpeded flow to the surface.~~ Even if there is unimpeded flow to the surface, the next question would be whether the cooling at the surface caps the flow. ~~Again, since we still exist,~~ Since we still exist, the most likely answer is that the surface cooling would abate the flow.",

But addressing if the lava would spill out of the tunnel non-stop, the answer is no, at least from a hydrostatic point of view.

It's like saying \"what would happen to my brain in space?... You know... Assuming I don't freeze or expand or burn and can breathe...\" What?! But anyway... If this hole were to magically occur it would depend on wether it occurs spontaneously or if the process took a long time, like with actual tools and machines. The diameter of the hole is also extremely significant because, as you know, the earth rotates and land migrates. If the size were, say, 2 miles in diameter then it would surely cause fantastic earthquakes, tsunamis, and cyclones because the tunnel will collapse upon itself within 56 hours.

The tunnel would be lodged firmly in the core and would appear to be moving at about 10 meters an hour, shredding the crust as it goes along, cutting through it like a knife, drawing two giant east-west circles at the surface points of the tunnels. There wouldn't necessarily be volcanic activity (think you're on a floating ice slab and you drill a line in it with a power tool - water still doesn't come out because you're still floating just like continents float on a giant lake of molten rock inside the Earth), but there would definitely be earthquakes and volcanos might still errupt if the pressure below the crust happens to be high enough.",

            "This is really a question better put to AskScience, but according to my geologist father, nothing would happen. First, a man-size hole (or even car- or house-size) would be infinitesimably small compared to the earth itself. It's like wondering why all the water in your skin doesn't run out of your pores. Second, such a hole, made the way you describe, would in effect be a continuing part of the surface (mathematically speaking), since you can't admit any part of the interior without destroying the hole. You would indeed require extremely strong tools and materials, greatly exceeding the capabilities of anything we have. If that was possible, and you were able to make the hole, then the hole would, for practical purposes, not be a hole into the earth, but a tunnel from one side to the other, around which the interior would flow (and not likely notice it, due to the enormity of comparative scale). And if you *did* admit the interior, the hole would immediately fill with whatever matter was at the level you admitted, and then cool solid at the top. You probably would get some lava and such at first, depending on where you do it, but it would seize solid soon enough, and you'd be left with an interesting feature. Unless, as others have suggested, the hole is extremely large, in which case, sure, it could be dramatic. But this is like asking what happens if you hit the earth with larger and larger stones. Somewhere between nothing and oblivion is a Michael Bay movie, but it's not especially interesting even as a thought experiement, since it only points to various points on the curve of possibilities, rather than frame a more interesting question with more variables.",

But here's the one I really remember: If you had a 3-foot diameter hole that went from one side of the earth, straight through the center to the other side, with an impervious material lining the walls of that hole, not much of anything would happen. if you then vacuum-sealed that hole, and put a near-frictionless car and rail system inside, you would have an extremely low-energy transport from one side of the earth to the other. It would be quite a fast trip, starting with the approximately 32.2 feet per second per second \"free fall\" acceleration, and gradually decreasing to the center, then gradually increasing to bring you to a cushy, 1g stop on the other side of the planet. This is entirely hypothetical, and completely undoable with today's technology. However, a hole that size through the center of the Earth would have negligible effect on anything else on the planet.

Digging through the core would no doubt disrupt this motion, and weaken if not destroy our magnetic field. No magnetic field means almost certain extinction of life on Earth. Bummer. Assuming our magnetic field was left intact, the question of where the material from the hole would end up arises. Wherever it was, a lot of the Earth's mass would now be there, which might skew the Earth's gravitational pull. I'm not an expert so I'm probably wrong. I'd love to hear an answer from someone who knows what they're talking about though. Very interesting question indeed.",

            "I'm actually having a lot of fun with this, so I think this warrants a direct reply. First issue I see is that the cylinder would need to be filled with air. Some have suggested this would cause weather disturbances, and it might. I don't think it'd be big though. Assuming a 1m cylinder, the total volume would be about 0.08km3. That's pretty small, in terms of atmosphere. 1.0x10-9 % of the atmosphere. I'm not a meteorologist, but i don't think that'd cause anything other than a stiff wind for a while. This assumes a constant pressure, which is, of course, not realistic. The pressure is actually a bit of a monster. For curiosities sake, I'm playing with it. If you just do a straight exponential calculation, assuming the mechanics all the way down are the same as on the surface, you'd get 2.145x1013 kPa. That's 20 000 000 000 the surface pressure, and more than enough to create what's called a supercritical fluid. At those pressures, the gases would actually \"condense\", but not in the conventional sense. It's a very strange state of matter that's tough to ELI5. However, this is not the case. Earth is not a point mass, and the gravitational force pulling on the air column would not be constant. So I'll fiddle with the calculus a bit more for fun, and let you know what it comes out to. [EDIT: I worked it out as far as I could, but apparently I broke WolframAlpha trying to solve it. So we may be out of luck here.] As for the magnetic field, I did't read anything that'd say it would be an immediate issue. Our magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core, which is driven by tidal forces caused by the Sun. A 1m radius tube would likely not cause a significant disruption here. The core is a problem though. The dynamics of the inner core are not well know, but most geologists agree that it's a solid (some imply a highly compressed liquid that acts solid, and a few other theories, but solid core seems to dominate). So we've just drilled a hole through a solid core. A core that has a faster angular rotation than the surface. So one of two things would happen: either the core would continue to rotate, and we would lose the tube pretty quick, or the core would stop relative to the surface. Not imagine how much angular energy is stored in a rotating, massive, sphere of highly dense nickel-iron alloy. That would all need to go somewhere.I don't know exactly how it'd be dispersed, but it would be like trying to stop a huge flywheel, and the results would likely be catastrophic. Extinction event catastrophic. The last issue, all the rest aside, comes down to temperature and radiation. The Earth's core is in the ballpark of 4 000K (about 4 300C, or 7 800F). There is no known substance that could shield from that heat, or any cooling method to avoid melting/combusting pretty much anything thrown in. Then there's the radiation. I couldn't find any exact numbers on concentration, so it's tough to find an exact dose. However, the Earth as a whole is estimated to produce 20TW of radioactive energy. So I'll go out on a limb and guess that the level would be past the lethal dose for a person, and probably irradiate any inorganic object going through. Let's assume that all this is a non-issue, for fun. Just to examine the timeline of jumping in. Since we are ignoring the fatal pressures, temperatures, and the like, let's just assume a complete vacuum. The number most people use to traverse the diameter of the planet is about 42 minutes, which isn't too bad (This number would not be affected by equatorial bulge, and would not have any significant difference due to elevation changes. Height is not a variable in a perfect pendulum). You'd hit about 11 000m/s at the core, assuming constant acceleration (some people are saying 8 000m/s. Not the number I got, but either way, it's crazy fast). Now, as you probably know, a perfect pendulum will reach exactly the same height at which it was dropped. Same for you. The elevation variations in the Earth's surface vary by about 0.22%. Not enough to make a significant difference in travel time, but definitely enough to make an impact on your arrival. So you'd likely fall short and oscillate infinitely. If there was any source of energy loss, you'd eventually settle at the core, experiencing zero G. Doesn't sound fun to me. However, you would also have angular velocity. Since the radius of rotation decreases with the descent, your relative lateral velocity would increase, and you'd end up riding the side of the tube all the way down, like a slide. Even though it's straight down, you'd fall kind of like it's angled. By the time you hit the core, all of the lateral energy would be gone. As you ascended, you'd now have *less* angular velocity than the tube, and slide all the way back up. Obviously, all this friction is a huge problem, and would pretty much destroy any hope you had of reaching the other side, unless we extended the hypothetical to include a frictionless tube. TL;DR This would be a very bad thing. You'd either destroy the planet, waste a lot of resources for something that wouldn't last, or inevitably become stuck in the core of the Earth forever. So let's not build this, okay? EDIT: Please feel free to review my statements. What I've found is hardly the gospel truth. Some of the theories I referenced are not completely accepted, some of my math may be off, and some is wild speculation. I mostly did this because I answered a few points, started digging, and then this behemoth formed. Also, apologies for it not all being completely ELI5, or for what likely may be a few spelling/grammar errors. This was just done on the fly between classes.",

It is a complex and multifaceted experience that plays a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing our emotions, memories, and behaviors. In this article, we will delve into the fascinating world of olfaction, exploring what it's like to have a sense of smell and the remarkable ways it shapes our experiences.\n\nThe Science of Smell\n\nThe sense of smell is mediated by the olfactory system, which consists of specialized cells in the nasal cavity that detect odor molecules in the air. These molecules bind to receptors on the surface of olfactory cells, triggering a signal that is transmitted to the brain. The brain then interprets this signal, allowing us to perceive and distinguish between different smells.\n\nThe sense of smell is closely linked to the brain's emotional centers, which is why smells can evoke powerful emotional responses. This is because the olfactory system is closely tied to the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory formation and emotional processing. As a result, smells can transport us back to specific memories and emotions, often with remarkable accuracy.\n\nThe Power of Smell\n\nThe sense of smell is incredibly powerful, with the ability to evoke strong emotional responses and even influence our behavior.

            "I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind. Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound. I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles. Maybe you can get a general feel for what people are saying by watching lips (so long as they face you), but you miss out on the effects of the background music for setting mood and all the foley effects.

            "Many of the responses here deal with the emotional response that smelling something produces. I think that's good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there's still a link in the chain there that's missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I'm sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn't explaining anything that you don't already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that's just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I'm a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I'm keenly aware of them and they can't be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can't ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That's generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren't overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you're just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don't linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after.",

            "I read an article about a woman who had a magnet in planted in her finger. This resulted in a new sense where she could feel magnetic flieds (like microwave ovens, high voltage lines, etc.) and detect near by metal. Thinking about this completely alien sense helped me to consider my other senses more objectively. So being able to smell actually gives you information about the chemistry of objects. Consider all the chemical reactions that take place in cooking; they result in differnt smells (and tastes). Smell can also tell you if fruit and vegiyables are ripe or even spoiled. Likewise of meat goes bad it give off a smell - kind of a warning. So you can think of that as being smiliar to being able to see or hear that information - since you get it from a distance. It it probably more similar to hearing since it doesn't require direct or uninterrupted \"line - of - sight\". Off all my senses, smell is the one that most often conveys bad information. For like in the case of spoilage, the smell is revolting. Like a loud sound, or a bright light. Smell is a really strong trigger for memories too. For many people smelling cookies reminds them of home. Or maybe certain foods remind them of holidays. The part of the brain that processes olfactory (smell) information is closely associated with memories. Because smell gets stronger the closer you get to the subject, it often times draws me in for smells I like (good food, a woman with nice colonge, the smell of the woods, etc.), or drives me away for ones I dislike (spoilage, feeces, filth, body oder, too much fragrance, etc). As a parent of small children, smell is one way I know my kids needs a clean diaper. Often times he\\she will get cranky (audible) or show other visual signs. The smell is another queue. My mother in law has no sense of smell, so she would always stick a finger in the diaper to veifiy - which is messy. I just look when I am unsure. Generally speaking smell is a way we learn things not to eat. There are some poisons that are adapted to smell good or not at all, but very few things that smell bad that are good for you (individual tastes aside). So smell is just another way to collect information at a distance from the world around us. Most of that information can be collected other ways too. Especially if you took chemistry and have isolated different compounds and elemtents. Smell is just a convenient way to do that.. Edit: hit post early.",

It's a very visceral, all-over feeling when one is enveloped by a familiar, pleasant smell. You feel your body open up to pull it in, your eyes close and you salivate involuntarily, and everything around you slows just a little bit. Think of it a little like being in the afterglow of a good orgasm. Conversely, a bad smell is not as often tied with memory but creates a very physical response just the same. You'll feel your throat close as you gag, and your stomach churn or heave. The smell feels viscous and heavy in your mouth, as though it's tangible and you've bitten down on it. It seeps into you, burns a little, and feels thick and wet in your throat like you're choking on something slimy.

            "The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened.

Instead of focusing on documentaries, they have shifted their attention to reality TV shows. This shift has raised questions about the impact on the quality of programming and the audience's viewing habits.\n\nHistorically, these documentary stations were founded with the mission of educating and entertaining audiences through factual content. History Channel, for instance, was launched in 1995 with the goal of exploring historical events and cultural heritage. Discovery Channel, established in 1985, focused on scientific and educational programming. TLC (The Learning Channel) was initially dedicated to educational and informative content, while Nat Geo has been a pioneer in documentary filmmaking since its inception in 1888.\n\nHowever, in the early 2000s, these stations began to experience a decline in ratings and revenue. As the television landscape changed, audiences became increasingly drawn to more sensational and entertaining content. In response, the documentary stations adapted to the changing market by incorporating more reality TV shows into their programming.\n\nOne of the primary factors contributing to this shift was the rise of cable television and the proliferation of channels.

            "Alright, sit yo ass down and get ready for a story. The TLDR is indeed ratings and production cost. But if that's the why, we must ask ourselves \"why now?\" What happened to these stations, and why did it all happen at the same time? Well, the seed of change (or pestilence if you wanna be poetic) is TLC. Before The Channel Formally known as Learning gave us child beauty pageants and whatever the fuck Honey Boo Boo is supposed to be. You see, in 2007 Discovery was kind of in a hole. As you may know Discovery owns, TLC, Nat Geo, Animal Planet and more. Despite their wide net, the brand was tanking. So they brought in a man from NBC (who would soon sell out to Comcast) to liven things up. The Discovery Channel store was closed, the main station started doing documentaries more fit for history channel with \"True crime\" exploitation pieces. This would in turn hemorrhage viewership from History (A sister network of A & E) who began showing programs like Gangland. Modern Marvels (which had existed since 1995) got a shiny update, and the content of the History Channel become the closest content rival for Discovery. But then, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, or more accurately here comes TLC's shit shows. Ya see, part of the way Discovery was able to have so many networks was appealing to different demos for each one. History had been nailing the males over 40 crowd and discovery had been shooting for educated younger males. TLC was basically discovery channel marketed to women in their early 20s to early 30s, and you know what bored women of that age-range were watching? Soaps, MTV/VH1 reality shows and celebrity gossip. Taking a \"documentary\" series about child fashion shows and editing it like an MTV reality show with a healthy bit of exploitation (the fans of these shows are watching to laugh at these people, make no mistake) and they suddenly had a the right ingredients for what would become a network of cheep, exploitative, schlock across all Discovery Networks (well, except the Science Channel). So What really happened? What really changed? Demographics. Say what you will about these networks being crap, they do a good job of not internally fighting with each other for attention. The Honey Boo Boo crowd doesn't want much to do with \"are Megladon's still around\" the age range, income level, and general education of the demo they're trying to reach can be reliably expected to enjoy the TV click bait. They figured out something Buzzfeed did before you wanted to inexplicably punch it in the face: people don't want to learn, they want to have what they know and like confirmed. This is how Discovery Channels' most profitable stretch, year after year, is telling people sharks aren't violent murder machines (except when they are but it's okay because not to people) like it's the first time anybody has heard this information. Apologies to Shark Week fans, but how surreal is it that the most educational thing on the network is telling a demographic that didn't grow up with Jaws shit they already know from last year? And then there's history channel. History is, again, owned by A & E not discovery. History is a tougher nut to dissect. In short, as they became more direct competition for Discovery they began duplicating what was making discovery successful. Deadliest Catch became Ice Road Truckers, bad speculative science docs became Ancient Aliens. History duplicated the pacing of TLC and marketed it to men, but dumbed its content down to turn the stuff with potential to be good into a filter for Discovery Channel's scraps. A & E went the way of TLC and now theirs no real market incentive to change. If you really want to know whose to blame, look in the mirror. The original demographics have moved on. We're watching Netflix and are simply too educated to watch a show about convergent mermaid evolution. Discovery says they're gonna start making quality programming again, so demand might be returning as Millennials get more disposable income (Oh right, the other big reason! Because of the whole recession thing, cheaper shows became a must and Gen-Xers aged 34-48 had more money than the groups they were, on paper, marketing towards so include this disclaimer in the paragraph about TLC's market shift) and educated young people starting families in their late 20s is presenting itself as a important demographic to snag. In short: The Economy tanked around the same time as the networks underwent massive internal restructuring. Networks that were in mild competition with each other entered a full race to the bottom and neither one went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.",

        "context": "The question of whether illegal immigrants in the United States have the right to bear arms is a complex and contentious issue. On one hand, the Second Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear arms to all citizens. On the other hand, illegal immigrants are not considered citizens and are therefore not entitled to the same constitutional protections.\n\nHistorically, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the Second Amendment applies only to citizens. In the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. However, the Court also emphasized that this right is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable regulations.\n\nIn the context of illegal immigrants, the issue becomes even more complicated. While illegal immigrants are not considered citizens, they are still human beings with inherent rights and dignity. The question is whether these rights include the right to bear arms.\n\nNotable insights from legal scholars and experts suggest that illegal immigrants may not have the same constitutional rights as citizens, but they may still have some rights under international law and the US Constitution. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the US has ratified, guarantees the right to life, liberty, and security of person to all individuals, re",

If it says person, then any human within the jurisdiction of the US has that right whether here legally or not. So, like the 5th and 14th amendments specify person, so they apply.",
            "There is a gigantic misconception among people that the Constitution gives us civil rights. As the Declaration of Independence says:  > We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In other words:  > It is obvious to all of us that every human being is born equal, and that all of us are born with certain fundamental rights that cannot be taken away; some, but certainly not all, of these rights are the right to be alive, the right to be free, and the right to choose how to live your life. The Constitution does not give us our human rights -- they're granted to us upon birth by God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever you believe to be the source of fundamental truth. Everyone has these rights. American or foreign, bad people, good people, your worst enemy. Saints, criminals, murderers -- everyone is born with fundamental rights and they *cannot be taken away* by human beings, because who are we to remove a gift bestowed by God? Because these rights are inherent, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights don't provide them; rather, the documents provide *prohibitions on the government* from infringing on the exercise of these fundamental rights we are all born with. The Founders believed that the best government would be one that honored and protected its citizens natural rights. Now, some infringement of our rights is necessary to provide for social welfare and order, but even here, it's more about balancing the exercise of our rights; e.g., when you deny a criminal his right to freedom in order to protect other people's right to live free of physical harm. These rights are distinct in the Constitution from the Privileges  &  Immunities of citizenship, which *are* the things that we are granted as Americans. These include things like the entitlement to vote, to travel freely between states, and to have free access to commercial markets. These privileges *are* granted by the government and *can* be taken away. The Constitution recognizes the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. So, yes, illegal immigrants have that fundamental right -- they were born with it, just as you are. However, as I said, the Founders and the Constitution recognize that complete anarchy leads to greater infringement on human rights (because the strongest just takes over as tyrant), so the government is allowed enact reasonable regulations that infringe on fundamental rights to the extent that they are necessary to protect social order and welfare. One of the infringements that's reasonable is prohibiting noncitizens from owning firearms -- it is reasonable for a nation to protect itself by preventing armed foreigners from roaming free within its borders.",
            "While many whip themselves into a lather, over the mistaken notion that illegal aliens are essentially given all the same rights and privileges as citizens, under our Constitution, it is important to point out that their guaranteed rights are not exactly the same as citizenship: Their protections stem from Section One, of the Fourteenth Amendment: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive **any person** of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to **any person within its jurisdiction** the equal protection of the laws.\"",

            "There are numerous laws which prohibit the possession of a firearm while in the commission of a crime. Illegal aliens by their very act of being here are committing an ongoing crime every second they're in the US without permission, hence being in the United States illegally and possessing a firearm is illegal.",
            "This is a case where there are some mixed decisions from federal courts. Some courts have found that illegal immigrants do have a right to bear arms, but many have not. The 7th Circuit, for example, found in 2015 that they do have a right to bear arms, but that a federal law prohibiting them from possessing firearms was somehow valid. Don't ask me how they figured that one. The 4th, 5th, and 8th Circuits have ruled that they do not have that right. What does that mean? It means this is a case that will likely be resolved eventually by the US Supreme Court."

This landmark legislation marked a significant shift in the country's approach to child welfare, prioritizing the timely placement of children in permanent homes.\n\n**Historical Context**\n\nPrior to ASFA, the adoption process was often lengthy and complex, with many children languishing in foster care for extended periods.

The answer lies in the complex interplay between our brain, heart, and emotions. In this article, we'll delve into the fascinating science behind the physical and emotional sensations of love, exploring the reasons why it can feel like a weight is pressing down on our chest.\n\nFrom a physiological perspective, the feeling of love is closely tied to the release of oxytocin, often referred to as the \"love hormone.\" Oxytocin is released during physical touch, intimacy, and social bonding, triggering a cascade of physical and emotional responses. When we experience love, our brain's reward system is activated, releasing a cocktail of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. These chemicals create a sense of pleasure, relaxation, and euphoria, which can manifest as a feeling of heaviness in the chest.\n\nBut why does this heaviness feel so intense? One reason is that the heart is closely linked to the brain's emotional centers. When we experience strong emotions, our heart rate and blood pressure increase, causing our chest to feel heavier. This physical sensation is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or tingling, which can be attributed to the increased blood flow and oxygenation of the heart.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the feeling of heav",

In this article, we will delve into the complexities of consciousness, exploring the various ways in which we can verify our wakefulness.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, the problem of knowing whether we are awake or asleep is known as the \"problem of self-awareness.\" It is a fundamental question that has been debated by thinkers such as René Descartes, who famously declared \"I think, therefore I am\" (Cogito, ergo sum) to establish the existence of his own consciousness. However, this statement only proves that he is thinking, not that he is awake.\n\nIn the scientific community, researchers have turned to neuroscience to shed light on the issue. Studies have shown that certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe, are more active when we are awake than when we are asleep.

The church is headquartered in Clearwater, Florida, and has a global presence with millions of followers worldwide. Despite its widespread reach, the Church of Scientology has been shrouded in controversy, sparking intense debate and scrutiny from critics and skeptics alike.\n\nAt its core, Scientology is a belief system that combines elements of spirituality, self-help, and science fiction. Hubbard, a prolific writer, developed the church's teachings through a series of books and lectures, which he claimed held the secrets to achieving spiritual enlightenment and improving one's life. The church's central tenet is the concept of the \"thetan,\" a spiritual being that exists outside of the physical body and is responsible for an individual's thoughts, emotions, and actions.\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been criticized for its authoritarian structure, which is led by a hierarchical system of leaders known as the \"Sea Organization.\" This inner circle is responsible for making key decisions and enforcing the church's teachings, often through strict discipline and punishment. Critics have accused the church of using coercive tactics to maintain control over its members, including forced labor, isolation, and psychological manipulation.\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Scientology is its use of \"auditing,\" a process in which members are asked to recount their past",

            "A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, it's certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google \"Xenu\" or \"Thetans\". There's a fairly recent book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it's gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you. But with so much social media these days I think they've had a hard time applying pressure on-line like they used to. **TL;DR** - It's mostly crazy bullshit, but *profitable* crazy bullshit.",
            "Well, not to speak on the actual religion's dogma (as most religions when examined are usually odd beliefs), the reason for controversy is the level of control they try to exert over their members, ex-members, and anybody who tries to criticize them. The means by which they have done this at times have been considered at a minimum, highly unethical or moral, or just plain illegal. They have been accused of fostering a \"cult-like\" mentality among their members.",

With the click of a button, we can access a vast array of information, products, and services. But have you ever wondered how internet searches can deliver results so quickly? The answer lies in the complex network of technologies and algorithms that work together to provide us with the information we need, almost instantaneously.\n\nThe journey of an internet search begins with the user's query, which is sent to a search engine's servers. The search engine, such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo, uses a sophisticated algorithm to process the query and retrieve relevant results. This algorithm, known as a search engine ranking algorithm, is designed to analyze the user's query and return the most relevant and accurate results.\n\nOne of the key factors that enables search engines to deliver results so quickly is the use of caching. Caching is a technique where frequently accessed data is stored in a temporary memory, allowing search engines to quickly retrieve the information without having to access the original source. This reduces the time it takes to retrieve the information, making it possible for search engines to deliver results in a matter of seconds.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the speed of internet search results is the use of distributed computing.

While it's true that times have changed, and the challenges faced by older generations were different from those of today, it's essential to understand the historical context and nuances to appreciate the complexities of the past.\n\nOne significant factor that contributed to the relative ease of older generations was the lack of technological advancements. In the past, people didn't have the constant distraction of smartphones, social media, and the internet. This meant that they were more present in their daily lives, with fewer options for instant gratification and entertainment. As a result, people were more likely to engage in meaningful conversations, build stronger relationships, and focus on their work and personal goals.\n\nAnother aspect that made life easier for older generations was the simplicity of daily tasks. Without the abundance of choices and options available today, people had to be more resourceful and adaptable. They had to rely on their own skills and creativity to solve problems, which often led to a greater sense of accomplishment and self-reliance.

            "For much of the postwar 20th century, if you were a young white man with at least a high-school education, you had to try *not* to get a job that would fund at least a lower-middle-class lifestyle. If you had a college degree in *anything*, even English or Art History, you were pretty much guaranteed a lifetime of desk jobs, each higher-paying and more powerful than the last, with The Firm, which would then take care of you through retirement with a pension. If you came into The Firm with a Bachelors, it might actually pay your time *and your tuition* for a Masters. When you went home at the end of the night, work was generally over - there was no email. Calling someone at home was a big deal and used mostly for emergencies. (This era is largely where the perception that the unemployed are just lazy comes from. There really was a time when you had to be lazy to be unemployed.) Nowadays, you need to get into a good elementary school that will prepare you to work hard in middle school so you can take the right classes in high school to get into a good college in a handful of the \"right\" majors, and then maybe go to graduate school, to stand a *chance* of getting a good job if you're also a friendly/interesting person who interviews well. Outside a handful of labor markets, your health insurance and retirement plans will be token benefits (if they exist at all). You'll need to hit the streets, blast your resume around, write a ton of cover letters, and practice your interview game so you can change jobs every few years to increase your salary with your experience. Employers certainly aren't handing out meaningful raises just for showing up. Your bosses may expect you to answer your cell phone or respond to texts/emails promptly late into the night. For blue-collar workers, much of this can be attributed to globalization and automation. For white-collar workers... as just one example, many corporations needed what was basically database functionality long before databases existed.

            "In the US young people have the problem of a changing nature of labor and the contract between worker and corporation. In past few decades wages have not increased with respect to ~interest rates~ inflation, in many ways they have decreased. This means we get a larger number in terms of dollars from the companies we work for, but we receive far less value for our work. So we have to work more. We work for smaller firms generally, shops and retail, tinier operations that make unionizing and collective bargaining less viable strategies for supporting our labor's value. A major reason for the existence of unions was to combat the spreading de-humanization of work, which simply put took satisfaction out of labor and alienated people. Additionally, they helped support labor in national politics. By and large people born in the past 20 years will never join or support a union, and won't be able to offer each other support for their livelihoods. This means goods are slightly cheaper, but labor is cheaper still, so we have to work more to stay solvent. Gains in women's rights and expanded diversity have slightly offset the effects of wage stagnation, but the crisis of 2008 shows us that we won't get back to the state of the mid-90s labor. The minimum wages your parents worked for briefly as youths are the wages you will work for until you are middle-aged, when you briefly make more and then get fired and have to work for minimum wages again (on average). In the past century our labor has become a substantial portion of our identities.

You will change jobs many times in your lifetime as a replaceable cog in a variety of machines that don't care about you. Oh, and you won't be able to retire on the average person's wages. You'll get no pension, and once you are fired for being less productive than a computer the company you worked for will forget you ever existed.

This enigmatic artifact has been a subject of interest for decades, and in this article, we will delve into its history, significance, and the mysteries surrounding it.\n\n**The Discovery**\n\nThe greywacke slab was discovered in the 1930s by a local farmer, who stumbled upon it while plowing his fields. Initially, the farmer thought it was a piece of petrified wood, but upon closer inspection, he noticed the intricate carvings of runes on its surface. The slab was later donated to the Fillmore County Historical Society, where it has been preserved and studied ever since.\n\n**The Runes**\n\nThe runes on the greywacke slab are a type of ancient writing system, believed to have originated in Scandinavia during the Viking Age (8th to 11th centuries).

His speech at the convention was a testament to his unwavering commitment to these causes.\n\nIn his speech, Jackson emphasized the importance of unity and coalition-building within the Democratic Party. He urged party leaders to prioritize the needs of marginalized communities, including African Americans, Latinos, and women. Jackson's speech was met with widespread applause and attention, as it highlighted the need for a more inclusive and diverse approach to politics.\n\nJackson's speech was also notable for its critique of the Reagan administration's policies, which he argued disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities. He called for a more progressive approach to economic policy, including increased investment in education, healthcare, and job training programs.\n\nThe 1984 Democratic National Convention was a pivotal moment in American political history, as it marked a shift t",

To provide a comprehensive answer, let's first explore the concept of distortion mirrors and their connection to music.\n\nDistortion mirrors, also known as \"distortion mirrors\" or \"mirror distortion,\" are a type of optical illusion that creates a warped and distorted image of an object or person. This phenomenon is often used in music videos, films, and other forms of visual media to create a sense of unease or disorientation. In the context of music, distortion mirrors can be used to create a sense of tension or unease, which is often a key element in rock music.\n\nNow, let's turn our attention to OK Go, a popular American rock band known for their catchy melodies, witty lyrics, and innovative music videos. Formed in 1998, OK Go has released several successful albums, including \"OK Go\" (2002), \"Oh No\" (2005), and \"Of the Blue Colour of the Sky\" (2010). The band's music often incorporates elements of power pop, indie rock, and new wave, making them a staple of the modern rock scene.\n\nSo, are distortion mirrors and OK Go both considered rock bands? The answer is a resounding yes. Distortion mirrors, as a concept, are often used in rock music to create a sense of tension or unease, while OK Go is a rock band that has built a reputation on their catchy melodies, witty lyrics, and innovative music videos.\n\nIn conclusion, distortion mirrors and OK Go may seem like unrela",

But what drives this perpetual raising of awareness, and is there a commercial benefit to it? The answer lies in a complex interplay of historical, social, and economic factors.\n\nBreast cancer has been a leading cause of cancer deaths among women for decades, with the first breast cancer awareness campaign launched in the 1970s. However, it wasn't until the 1990s that the pink ribbon became a symbol of the movement, thanks to the efforts of breast cancer survivor and activist, Evelyn Lauder. Lauder, who co-founded the Estee Lauder Companies, recognized the power of branding and marketing to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer research.\n\nThe commercial benefit of breast cancer awareness is undeniable. The pink ribbon has become a lucrative marketing tool, with companies paying millions of dollars to participate in breast cancer awareness campaigns. In 2020, the National Breast Cancer Foundation reported that over $1 billion was raised for breast cancer research and awareness through corporate sponsorships alone.\n\nBut is there still a need for breast cancer awareness?

Komen for the Cure isn't doing much to fight breast cancer *financially* -- don't donate to them! But they have been effective in raising awareness, which is good in general. A good awareness campaign was the ALS ice bucket challenge. You didn't need to pay anyone to do it (other than ice and bucket providers, I guess) and you would donate directly to research instead of to professional awareness campaign managers like Komen.

And has the most successful marketing plan, think about it, how many \"specific cancer\" months can you name most of the big ones have a month but none with the prevalence of breast cancer. Women in the USA make far more purchasing decisions than Men so it is not a stretch to think that buying power hasn't reached to charitable endeavors as well. So breast cancer has high visibility, and I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, just that it, is, a thing. The fact of the matter is that raising breast cancer awareness can be an effective vehicle for general awareness of all cancers.

            "I'll say something other than the conspiracies (however much truth there may be) here. Awareness is so much more than making someone aware of beat cancers mere existence. Awareness is about knowing and recognizing the signs in yourself and others, so that the disease can be detected early, and thus be more easily treated. For example, I bet most people who have heard of breast cancer haven't heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It's a rare form of breast cancer that forms in sheets instead of lumps. By the time it's detectable as a misshapen breast, is usually already at stage 4. Another example is that men can and do get breast cancer. Most men don't realize this, and would have absolutely no idea how to monitor for it. That's another part of awareness: knowing who is at risk. Most people only know that lumps = breast cancer. But there are many kinds that manifest in different ways. Awareness helps (or should) people understand more about the disease, not just make them aware that it exists. This should be the case for most cancers, but breast cancer gained traction due to its prevalence in modern America, and organizations like SGK getting the word out. P.S. Try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when talking about breast cancer awareness. There are shady people trying to profit off it, sure, but there are also a lot of people out there who this cause is very important to, and are trying to help with nothing but the best intentions. My sisters and I are considering starting a charity for IBC awareness and research, in honor of our mother who died from it. We've already hosted a few fundraisers whose proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. There are people out there trying to help. I'm one of them.

The main reason is awareness and clarity. People don't get checked. They get cancer and then it's too late. If you get frequent checks you might prevent cancer or find it at a point that it can be removed. Terminal cancer is often found too late and could have been prevented. Since the awareness month and company campaigns, breast cancer deaths HAVE went down, and prevention has went up. That result is good and has saved the life's of your mothers, sisters, and wife's. So what if komen pays its ceo 85% of all the earnings. Some companies focus on awareness and the promotion of the message instead of actual research and that does result in life's saved. All it takes is that pink shirt or commercial to get that stubborn woman to get a check. Plenty of other companies over pay their CEOs and higher up while doing nothing for the community and saving no life's. Look at the positives, and if you know the facts, donate to different charities like the research programs themselfs but don't ask for the abolishment or harass the ones like komen, because without them we have a lot less awareness and advertisement.

They do fund some things like mammos for poor women but the amount of money spent by people buying pink stuff is way more than is spent on research.

            "Seems like there are many cynics out here. It's true there are many parasitic organizations that capitalize on our charity and good will, but the fact is that breast cancer is one of the many cancers where death is preventable if caught in early stages. This is alongside cervical (get your pap smears at 21 ladies, and HPV vaccines for everyone), prostate for men (older men should do digital rectal exams), and of course lung (stop smoking). It's a little unfair to say that breast cancer is the only one getting awareness when all these other cancers are also getting attention. I think breast cancer was the first big movement because you are able to do a self-exam and that is empowering to women, so it is now the biggest (btw the main reliable screening tool is regular mammographies, so self-exams are a start, but not sufficient). Just to provide a scale of the problem, more than 50% (a half!) of women will develop a benign breast lesion. Fortunately most of these are not lethal and should not progress to a malignancy. More than 10% of women will develop a true malignancy, where your odds of survival are almost exponential the earlier you catch it. So it's kind of important to make it common knowledge how to find a lump in your breast, because there's a chance that it might kill you. That's not to deny the aforementioned parasitic organizations. I guess the best advice is find a good charity of your choice and ignore the bad ones, but don't hate on the movement as a whole because it is trying to make a difference for the American public.",

As you might be aware, most non-profit organizations have to divide their resources between administration and their cause. What you might not be aware of is that a lot of the administrative costs go toward finding more funding. Unless a non-profit has a stable stream of income from committed donors, grants, or an endowment, every non-profit is in constant pursuit of more sources of revenue. This often means hiring a professional grant writer and hosting some sort of open house or gala that informs and solicits donors. Even stable non-profits will probably be constantly pursuing more revenue to further their cause and expand their programs. The Komen Foundation decided to try a for-profit marketing campaign in order to get revenue. The people they hired advised them to have an ambitious advertising campaign with the justification that it would bring in a lot more revenue than it cost. It cost a ton of money but it was wildly successful, so they have kept it up and followed those strategies. The obvious downside is that an inappropriately large percentage of their budget goes toward marketing, which increases awareness but does not create a cure.

This can be argued because it's a cancer that affects privileged men VS under privileged women. Supporting womens causes is seen as progressive.

        "context": "The Expiration of Baked Goods: Separating Fact from Fiction\n\nWhen it comes to baking, the expiration date of ingredients is a crucial consideration. But what happens when you use an ingredient that's close to expiring? Does the expiration date of the cake also become nullified? In this article, we'll delve into the world of food science to explore the relationship between ingredient expiration and the shelf life of baked goods.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that expiration dates are not a hard and fast rule. They are rather a guideline set by manufacturers to indicate the quality and safety of a product. In the case of milk, the expiration date is typically determined by the manufacturer based on factors such as the product's composition, storage conditions, and expected shelf life.\n\nWhen you bake a cake using milk that's close to expiring, the expiration date of the milk does not directly affect the expiration date of the cake. The cake's shelf life is determined by a combination of factors, including the type of ingredients used, the baking process, and the storage conditions.\n\nIn general, baked goods can be safely stored for several days to a week or more, depending on the type of cake and the storage conditions. For example, a cake made with milk that's close to expiring may still be safe to eat for several days if stored properly in an airtight container at room temperature.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using expired or spoiled ingredients can affect th",

        "gold_answer": [
            "The expiration date from the milk is no longer relevant. Your cake will have the same shelf regardless of whether you used milk expiring tomorrow, or milk expiring much later, because you have killed all the bacteria that were going to make the milk spoil.",
            "I worked at a food production facility and it's cool how much effort went into knowing the answers to this type of question. Every ingredient in a product that ends up for sale is considered and chosen for that recipe based on freshness dates. If certain ingredients are not as fresh then the 'sell by' date is changed. Potato salad with all fresh ingredients gets, say, three days on the shelf before the mayo goes off. That's basically universal, so extended shelf life means added salts, maybe sugar or vinegar but usually salt. So if your local deli has takeout potato salad and they say it's good for 2 days refrigerated and Wal-Mart has a tub of it but it's good for 6 days and we can assume similar ingredients ( they don't have magic mayo ) then it's a guarantee the extra 4 days come from the massive amount of added salt.",
            "There are a few different dates that get put on food, and they have different meanings. **Sell by** - mostly meaningless to consumers. A note for the store to discard the food after this date, but it's often a week or more before the food goes bad. Ignore this date, or add a week to it. Your milk probably has this date on it. **Best before** - a note for the customer. Quality can't be 100% guaranteed after this date, so you can't sue if it's not up to par, but it's still edible. **Use by** - this is a real one, but it only means quality may degrade after this date. If it smells okay, it's likely still safe. However, all of the above applies to ***unopened*** food. Once you open it, you introduce bacteria and humidity, and if you don't store it properly the date on the package doesn't matter. There are different ways food goes \"bad\" once it's opened: - **Stale/dry:** The flavor or texture is changed by the air. It doesn't taste the best, but it's not bad for you. - **Rancid:** Oils go bad. Some oils are prone to going bad from oxygen, heat, and light. Not only do they taste and smell bad, but they can chemically harm your body. - **Contaminated:** Bacteria grow when there's water or moisture. The bacteria can make you sick, and many bacteria (like botulism) make toxic wastes. Cooking it well kills the bacteria, but cooking won't get rid of the toxins. - **Moldy:** Fungus grows when there's moisture. If you see fuzzy mold or weird colors *anywhere* on the food, it's everywhere in the food. Throw it out. Now, back to the milk. The date on the carton is likely the \"sell by\" date, not an expiration date. Once it's home, add a week to get a better expiry date. Regardless of the date, if you haven't opened it yet, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. If you opened it in the past week and kept it in the fridge, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. It's been in the fridge open for more than a week... bacteria may have gotten in. Pour a bit into a cup and give it a smell. Your nose is good at detecting when something is off. **If it smells ok, it's probably good to cook with.** Cooking will kill off any bacteria and reset the expiration date. Cooking will likely fix stale or dry food too. You can put stale tortilla chips in the oven and they'll be good as new. You can cook with milk beyond its date if it smells fine. **If it looks or smells weird or gross, don't cook with it.** Cooking can kill bacteria, but it can't get rid of the toxic wastes from the bacteria or fungus, and it can't fix any rancid oils. However, you should know that if you're immune system is suppressed (old, very young, pregnant, or otherwise vulnerable to infection) then you should definitely keep to the printed \"use by\" dates and don't eat things after a few hours at room temperature or a few days in the fridge. This stuff may be lightly contaminated but still safe for most people, but it may be dangerous if your immune system can't handle the extra bacteria. You can still cook with it if you cook it thoroughly, but just be cautious.",
            "Somewhere in-between. The milk is no longer plain milk, it has combined with other ingredients in new combinations, and been cooked (which kills bacteria). But there are so many variables in the milk, the other ingredients, cooking time, and so on, that it's tough to set a new expiry date.",
            "In that case, you've heat killed the bacteria and other harmful pathogens that could grow in it. Chemically, the milk reacts with the other ingredients resulting in a new mixture that may or may not be sustainable for pathogens.",

However, this is not the case. Microsoft actually uses a different operating system to develop their new operating systems. In this article, we will delve into the surprising truth behind Microsoft's operating system of choice.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nMicrosoft's early days were marked by a close partnership with IBM, which led to the development of the first version of Windows, Windows 1.0. As the company grew, so did its reliance on other operating systems. In the 1990s, Microsoft began to use a modified version of the Unix operating system, known as NTFS, to develop Windows NT.\n\nThe Shift to Linux\n\nIn the early 2000s, Microsoft made a significant shift towards using Linux, an open-source operating system, to develop their new operating systems. This decision was largely driven by the need for a more flexible and customizable platform. Linux offered Microsoft the ability to create a more modular and scalable operating system, which was essential for the development of their new operating systems.\n\nNotable Insights\n\nMicrosoft's use of Linux has had a significant impact on the development of their new operating systems. For example, the company's Azure cloud platform is built on top of Linux, which has enabled them to offer a more scalable and flexible cloud computing solution. Additionally, M",

Many of these parts either don't change much from version to version all that much. So it is not like they have to rewrite everything all at once. It seems they start out with making changes to the core and once that runs halfway well they use their development on that to upgrade al the other parts. Early previews of new Windows versions often still have a host of features from the previous version that have not yet been updated or deleted."
