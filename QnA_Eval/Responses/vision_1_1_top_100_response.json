The criticism in Germany over the film was due to casting, especially Tom Cruise, who they thought played the role as too American.",
            "Lets put it this way. In Germany, displaying Nazi symbols, publicly praising Hitler and denying the Holocaust are all illegal and will result in jail time",
            "American lady married to a German man and we currently live in Germany. Germans have it beat into them from a very early age that the Holocaust was horrible. That there is no excuse for what Hitler did. That you do not put country above being a human being. If am correct it took up the majority of their history lessons (this does not mean that they at unaware of the world). Secondly, TV here is forever running documentaries on the holocaust and WWII. I am pretty sure I have seen footage at least once a day. Third, I have never been in a place where people are so quick to defend a person being verbally or physically attacked by another person. On the train I have seen many altercations (verbal) that generally ends with the asshole being called out by at least two other people (sometimes the entire train car gets pissed). So they aren't generally ones to stand by and let that shit happen. That being said it has caused some issues. In Germany it is illegal to argue facts of the Holocaust in public. The official story has not changed in a long time even with new data and facts present. Historians can lose their jobs or be arrested for trying to argue on the side of truth. So, there is that. It has also made racism a very difficult thing to talk about. No one wants to talk about the fact that German citizens with Turkish parents are still treated like subcitizens ....but they are. Lastly, this does not mean that Germans don't have a sense of humor about Hitler. I would, however, suggest that if you crack a Hitler or Holocaust related joke that you know the person you are talking to very well and refrain from doing so in public. People are very vigilant when it comes to anything Nazi related. Graffiti is covered quickly after the police are contacted. Edit: to be clear Germans dislike Hitler. There is no type of worship on the part of the German people..some even still feel guilty. Some don't like joking about him. Overall the German people feel a duty to not sit by and allow a new Hitler to do what Hitler did. So, they study history and they talk about it.",

However, many also think that they have to feel guilty for what someone else did decades ago, which in my opinion is inapropriate - it's not my fault what Hitler did, right? Hence, I don't think I have any kind of responsibilty towards the jewish people. So that's the other side of the coin: You should not say anything against jewish people because you will instantly be called a Nazi. It's complicated.",

            "I know a few Germans, and whenever the Nazis or Hitler are brought up, they get kind of quiet and have a look of shame on their face. One who was more open to talking about it says many Germans would go back in time and undo what Hitler did. As mentioned before, my friend said there are many laws restricting Nazi propaganda and racism in particular. Last main thing he pointed out is \"If you go anywhere in Germany asking where Dachau is [one of the concentration camps and now a historical museum for those who don't know], many will pretend they have never heard of it,\" and he continued by saying it's because there are people in denial, not because they are dicks and refuse to believe any of it happened, but because they feel guilty of the country's past and wish it never happened.

Homeless, pennyless folks can walk into an emergency room and receive care for their major injuries/illnesses, and your parents are gonna pay for that. * b) Cheaper. Homeless, pennyless deadbeats can get PREVENTATIVE care for free under Obamacare, and that care is way cheaper than fixing the problem later when it's about to kill them and they come into the emergency room. * c) Gonna help your parents. Maybe, god forbid, your Dad gets cancer. The stress makes him do worse at work and he's fired. He is uninsurable. Nobody would cover him, since he has cancer, a pre-existing condition if there ever was one. Under Obamacare, he can (and in fact is required to) still be insured.

Welfare, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, etc. The biggest of these were set up in the 30's during the Great Depression. It was Roosevelt's New Deal. So, it's not like President Obama created those. Obamacare was called by many as the completion of the New Deal. It fills in the last missing piece, (nearly) universal health care. I think the simplest justification comes down to this. Are we a nation that lets its poorest citizens die because they can't afford health care? If not, then we all need to chip in to help.",
            "This is already true. Your parents live in a fantasy world where they don't already pay for other people's healthcare. If \"foodstamp collectin' dead beats\" can't afford a visit to a doctor they can just walk into an ER and skip out on the bill instead. They'll potentially have bill collectors after them but if they are genuinely poor little will be gained by that. People who can and do pay their medical bills pay more to make up for those people. The key point to note is that ER care is the most expensive possible way someone like that could receive treatment. A doctor's visit may only be around $200 to treat a common ailment, but given the person was unable or unwilling to pay they just cost us all a $2,000 ER visit. **tl;dr** Your parents can either pay the \"dead beats'\" $2,000 ER bill (no ObamaCare) or pay the \"dead beats'\" $200 doctor bill (ObamaCare). The third option where they don't pay either is a figment of their imagination.",

If we don't, then we're letting honest unemployed people - people who are genuinely trying to find a job - we're saying they don't deserve health care if they get sick. We're saying that they're so worthless that if they get sick, they should literally *die*. Is that really what we've come to as a society, to say that if you're between jobs, then you're a worthless human being who deserves to die of an untreated sickness? I find that view repugnant.",

Very little money is being reallocated from your parents taxes to the poor as a result of Obamacare. Obamacare is paid for in two major ways, and a lot of minor ways. The major ways are cuts to Medicare, and taxes on the rich. The minor ways are increasing the burden on states via Medicaid (Supreme Court undid some of this, saying it can't be forced on states), increasing taxes in a few areas like tanning beds, and making some people pay more in taxes by decreasing flexible spending caps. If your parents were very rich, they have a point. If they are Medicare recipients, they sort of have a point, but their point would be saying \"Some of our future planned entitlement money is being used as an entitlement for another group.\" Overall, for the average American, Obamacare doesn't shift much money around from what they pay or to where it goes.",
            "An economist would say healthcare has a [positive externality]( URL_0 ). You can look at it like this: * The amount a person buys of a good (eg doctor visits) is based on how many they want and how much they can afford. This is referred to as the **private benefit**. * There are some things you can buy that make everyone better off. For example: going to the doctor every time you are sick will make you less likely to make other people sick. This is referred to as a **public benefit**. * Because only the private benefit is taken into account when someone is buying something, people buy less of a good than is **socially optimal** (private benefit + public benefit) * Governments give money to people so that they will buy more of these goods in order to make everyone else feel better (ie get closer to the socially optimal amount of consumption). Positive/Negative externalities are the driving force behind a lot of government policy. Edit: Formatting",
            "You know, I steer clear of US Politics threads for the most part, because I'm not American. But this one particular issue is one that baffles me. I don't understand why it is such a big deal in the USA. Yes, government tax revenue pays for healthcare. The rest of us in the first world have been doing this for decades. Ask whether Government should provide free schooling for those same freeloading poor people? And free roads too for those too poor to use private toll roads? Some people will always pay for private schools and Hospitals etc, but that doesn't mean free options shouldn't exist also. For the record, I am an Australian with private health insurance. I have never used it beyond dental and optical. The last time I was at hospital, I went public.",
            "This is an honest view. What it means is that they value 'fairness' more than they value 'care' for everyone. It means they are willing to let people who they perceive to be freeloaders suffer and even die. It's not illogical at that level, though clearly it does display an enormous amount of ignorance about who is benefitting from ObamaCare, but mostly it is unfortunate for anyone who needs that help, and what's more unfortunate, is that most Republicans share this view. For more on this, look up Jonathan Haidt, who I generally think is an idiot, but has collected some great data.",

        "response": "I think there may be some confusion here! Edward Snowden is a whistleblower who leaked classified information, but he is not related to the moth Gymnoscelis tylocera.",
        "gold_answer": [
            "[In his own words]( URL_0 ):  >  A number of detractors have suggested that if Snowden, who disclosed controversial top-secret N.S.A. programs to reporters, truly wanted to commit an act of civil disobedience for reasons of conscience, then he should have faced the legal consequences, making his case to the American public while standing trial at home.  >  When I asked why he didn’t take this route, Snowden said that because of the way national-security laws have been interpreted since September 11, 2001, he believed that the government had deprived him, and other whistle-blowers, of ever having the opportunity to make their cases in this time-honored tradition. Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, “It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.”)  >  Snowden said that he would “love” to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, “I have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they’re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I’m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so. But they’ve declined.”  >  Instead, Snowden said, “They want to use special procedures. They want a closed court. They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.” So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn't believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a \"show\" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently.",
            "No one has mentioned this yet or at least not very succinctly: The crime he is accused of (Violating the Espionage Act of 1917) doesn't allow you to defend yourself and the Supreme court has previously ruled this is not a violation of free speech. I feel like more people need to know that.",
            "The Supreme Court wouldn't need to get involved here. ~~They generally only get involved in constitutional issues (that is, interpreting the United States Constitution).~~ Snowden committed a crime, there's no two ways about it. What he did may or may not have been morally or ethically right or wrong, but under current law, he committed a crime. Even if SCOTUS finds what the NSA did to be illegal, it still wouldn't exonerate him of his crime.",
            "He could, but he's afraid that he would lose. Which is reasonable, seeing as he almost certainly would. Even *if* we make the incredibly generous assumption that there's no corruption in the American government, and that there's no incentive to protect the NSA, Snowden still committed a crime. Someone else doing something illegal doesn't usually give you the right to also do something illegal. So it's entirely possible that while the NSA will be penalized for their actions, so will Snowden. And that's really the best case scenario, seeing as there *is* likely incentive for the government to protect the NSA. Or worse, there might be actual *justification* for the NSA's actions, which will seriously hurt any of Snowden's defenses. So even if he gets a fair trial he'll probably be found guilty, and it's certainly a reasonable fear that he wouldn't get a fair trial. Coming back is really a no-win scenario for him.",
            "Alright since this is explain like I'm 5.... Ever see a bully on the playground harassing other kids, not letting them live their lives fairly, creepily monitoring their movements? Imagine if you exposed that bullying to everyone in town and move across state to avoid him. Then, the bully says, \" hey man its okay, just come talk with me in private and let's work this out? I promise I'll treat you fairly!\" Would you walk right into a sucker punch?",
            "Get real. He will never get a proper and fair trial in the US. He will either \"have an accident\" or \"commit suicide\".",
            "Are you really asking why the government wouldn't give Snowden a fair trial for exposing the government? Just think about it for a moment. It doesn't matter what the laws are, the government made and enforces the laws. He leaked stuff that the government did not want leaked. He would not get a trial, he would just be detained indefinitely, and indefinitely might as well mean eternally because only a super hero would ever be able to break him out, not any kind of lawyer, not even the next president or 5 presidents from now. That is what happens when you try to expose your own government, in nearly any country. America is no exception. There's your ELI5 answer.",
            "Hypocrisy. If you look at what Snowden released the gist of it is that the U.S. security apparatus (NSA in this case) is spying on everyone in the world including American citizens (without a wire tap warrant signed by a judge, aka due process) and foreign heads of state ( a breach of diplomatic protocol). Snowden let the public know what was going on. The powers that be call this treason and would like to do to him what was done to the Rosenbergs. Up to this point the government sounds both reasonable and consistent. Later, however, we find out that the Chinese are doing the same thing, as are the Brits, the Russians, and basically any country that bothers to do so is in fact doing so. Now the situation is that Snowden didn't release any information to the 'enemy' because like the U.S. they had it all to begin with. The only thing that Snowden did was to let everyone else know what the governments were doing. He pissed off bureaucrats, nothing more.",
            "* he doesn't believe he will be given a fair trial * even if he gets a fair trial, he pretty clearly broke that law, and likely will go to prison * he doesn't believe he will be treated fairly in prison",
            " > why couldnt Snowdens case reach the Supreme Court and a ruling in favor of Snowden Sure, that *could* happen. Or Snowden could be found guilty, have his appeal denied by the supreme court (or have them rule against him), and spend the rest of his life in prison for treason. He clearly doesn't want to take that risk.  > and/or an Amendment/Act created that would deem the activities of the NSA illegal? Such an act would not impact Snowden, because it wouldn't make what he did legal.",
            "Because he would die in a \"traffic accident\" before there was any hope. Also he technically broke a ton of laws(even though it was the right thing to do) the court would still lock him up",
            "You know how manning was treated? That's why. And he doesn't stand a chance, supreme court can't and won't help him.",
            "Someone like Snowden would be tried for treason and espionage. This isn't a larceny charge or even a murder charge, where fair trials are your right and the burden is on the prosecution to prove guilt. That's simply not the case here. If someone like Snowden ever made it to trial, it would not be the kind of trial you see on TV. In fact, it would probably be worst and more on-sided than Hussein's trial, and he was a monster.",
            "I just thought of something. Couldn't the defense argue that Snowden cannot be charged with violating the Espionage Act as he leaked the classified documents to Wikileaks, which is not a hostile government but closer to a corporation? Yeah he leaked classified information, but didn't actually hand it over to Russia so it isn't actually treason."

            "Well Billy, it's like this... When you're young, being an adult seems like a really great thing. You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there's all that naughty stuff you're not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what \"they want to be when they grow up\". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don't really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You've got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you've got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You've also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you've got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don't pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you're not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you've never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you're going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it's going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can't afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there's all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won't, but... there's a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you're not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you've ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won't ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don't have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it's not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn't make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don't have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It's a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren't so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve. That's part of why people are depressed, Billy. And that's all without mentioning the wars and the suffering and the poverty in countries other than our own, places we would like to help because they're people just like us... but we're too busy struggling to get by ourselves, to really help them as much as we'd like. Grown up life is hard, Billy. I'm sorry.",
            "Being depressed is not at all like being sad, while a 5 year old might not see the difference it is pretty clear to anyone that suffers from depression that they are not quite the same. About the only thing you can tell a 5 year old is that a person suffering from depression has a brain that is telling them to be depressed. Sometimes medications help to make it harder for the brain to tell them to be depressed. That said, there are basically two types of depression, there is situational depression (and this usually has a large component of sadness with it) and there is chronic depression which is not really a \"sadness\" as much as a feeling of apathy and a lack of motivation. Brain chemistry is a very complicated and while we know a lot about what is happening, there is still much we do not know, so medications involve a lot of trial and error.",

The same way that you can have some sort of stomach or lung or heart disease, you can have brain diseases, where your brain doesn't work quite right.

Depending on the balance of the good and the bad, you'll say you had a good, or a bad day. Now imagine that I selectively dull your capacity to feel the good parts of the day. Most days will, on balance, be bad. That's depression, in a nutshell. It's not necessarily that you feel things are especially bad, it's just that you have a lot of trouble feeling that the good makes up for it.",
            "There is evidence that depression is quite over diagnosed and over medicated. ( URL_0 ) So, really, there may not be \"so many people\" with depression at all. Everyone who is depressed is unhappy, but not everyone who is unhappy is depressed.",

Or say you're an old person whose immune system has simply weakened overall. In any of these cases, the unvaccinated child is a danger.",
            "There is also the chance of enough un-vaccinated people acting as a \"breeding chamber\" for the illness, allowing it to mutate and infect vaccinated people. Considering the long duration before a new vaccine can be made and given out, this is a pretty damnable risk.",

For example, the whooping cough vaccine (DTAP), only protects about 60% of infants after the first dose. It isn't until after the 3rd or 4th dose (at about 12 months old) that almost all vaccinated babies are fully immune to whooping cough. In all of the above examples, those people rely on the immunity of those around them. When the vaccination rate in a community drops, it allows preventable diseases to spread if introduced. That's why people who can get vaccinated but don't put their entire community at risk.",

            " >  Curious how hd tv is easily sent over the air but hd video streaming online takes high bandwidth and a good internet connection. A television broadcast is like talking into a loudspeaker system to address an entire stadium. Video streaming online is like holding an individual conversation with every person in the stadium simultaneously.",
            "There is some buffering when receiving video OTA, the buffering happens immediately after tuning. With OTA the stream is always there, and it's always on, all you have to do is grab the first decipherable packet and start deciding, you know the next one will be along immediately because it's guaranteed, furthermore if you drop a packet there is nothing you can do about it, so the stream is encoded to be able to continue with minimum disruption but obvious glitches. With internet streams the computer fetches a bunch of data because it doesn't know for sure when the next packet is arriving, the connection might at any moment stop delivering packets for a few moments, so you have to have sufficient data available to ride the gap and this riding the gap /can/ be invisible if you don't run out of buffer, so streaming video will pause and recontinue from the same location because in some cases you can do it without the user noticing. Why the gaps happen is because the internet is a series of pipes of different diameter.... the wire from your house to the exchange can handle less traffic than the wire from the exchange upstream, so obviously when you request a big file somebody has to rate limit the transfer because the internet itself isn't going to hold huge files in transit, the way that any part of the network shows it's over capacity is to randomly not transmit a packet - so YouTube thinks it's sent you the next instalment, but you never receive it, think of what this would do to a game of chess by post, how do you know that your move has been lost in the post? The answer is to resend your last move if you don't get a timely response, but this delay when viewing video causes skips. The most obvious restriction you can ease is the one between yourself and the exchange, buying fast internet means less dropped packets which means less stalls and a faster refill of your video buffer.",
            "Adding on to the other excellent answers here, I will add that traffic and contention are an issue. You are probably aware about how sometimes Internet traffic can get slower based on how many people are using it. This is a major cause of buffering with video streaming, because you're sharing almost the entire length of the connection with many other people. When you watch HD TV over the air, this isn't a concern. Nobody else is using that bandwidth. It's all 100% reserved for the television station. It's a specific frequency range that is legally reserved for them -- so they have all that bandwidth, every hour of the day, every day of the week. Also, it's broadcast, so your TV doesn't have to interact with the source of the transmission -- just pick up the signal and show it. This means that it doesn't matter if one person is watching it or a million. The full signal gets to you."

Could be wrong: Nighttime is when you have a chance to reflect on your day, your decisions, etc. The typical distractions are all gone and so you have a chance to think more thoroughly about what you have experienced.

            "Im no genius on the matter but as i have been experiencing this for as long as i can remember i mostly think it has to do with two things, first of all when you go to sleep you are tired so your mind might be easier to manipulate in a way, therefore when tired and lying in bed thinking everything is a bit more extreme compared to usual with no rational thinking involved and the second reason is when you arent even tired and you still experience these extreme thoughts while lying in bed has to probably(at least i think) as others have said to do with that you are lying in bed and \"stuck\" there, you're to lazy to stand up get water to clear your mind so you just lie there in this loop of bad thoughts which just keep on getting worse over time.",
            "There are a couple of things at work here: 1) you aren't distracted by the workaday stresses of life. You have time to reflect and ponder the day, week, month, life, and so forth. 2) Your body is actually more receptive to dopamine, estrogen/androgen, and other chemicals it naturally produces during this time. It's an old evolutionary trait that allowed for us to be more alert during dangerous times, like night-time. So, in summation: no distractions and hypervigilance leads us to \"feel\" things more strongly at night.",
            "I could be wrong but maybe it has to do with the fact that not being fully awake could alter your sense of rationality and priority. Being tired makes you think differently since you aren't as alert, certain \"filters\" could be removed because you won't need them as you sleep (ie making decisions and thoughts that you may have while on autopilot shut off and you are left with the thought of everything)",
            "I think its also to do with how tired you are mixed with the fact that once you're in bed you have no more of that day left to think about so the only thing to think about is on a larger scale e.g. *your life*.",
            "People are talking about how nighttime is a quiet time where you have nothing to do and think about your daily decisions. I want to guess that it also has to do with sleeping and dreams. Dreams have been reported to contain mostly negative emotions, specifically stress. Even in good dreams, there's still usually an element that stresses you out. \"My house was a mansion this whole time?! Aw man, why didn't I know this before? What am I going to do with all this space now? If it wasn't a mansion, would my house have been less expensive?\" During sleep, it is believed that memories formed during the day are being stored away into long term memory. Dreams are believed to be the signals that the brain picks up on and erroneously interprets as perception during this process. It seems as though stressful memories are more likely remembered, so you know how to deal with stress later, and dreams are accidentally a way for you to practice dealing with stress without the risk of failure. Also, scientists performed experiments with people falling asleep hooked up to brain scanners. During early stages of sleep, they were woken up, but they reported that they didn't feel like they even began to fall asleep at all. This suggests that awake/asleep is more like a sliding scale, and we don't always know how conscious we are. Therefore, when you try to fall asleep, your brain is probably already preparing to store away stressful memories and have a dream.",

            "One problem with a world-wide currency is neatly demonstrated by Greece and the Euro. One major way that a country can deal with hard times is to allow, or even force, their currency to be worth less. That makes the things you, as a country, make cheaper, and things you buy from other countries more expensive. So the country loses less money paying for exports, and makes more money selling its now cheaper exports. They can also create new money to pay for government spending, creating employment and pulling the country back onto its feet. If there is only one currency, a country can't do this. Their citizens keep buying imports, and their exports remain too expensive, and they can't recover without cutting back hard on government spending, which makes the hard times worse.",
            "A single currency isn't even working particularly well in Europe right now. Being in control of the currency is incredibly useful for a government. They can use the power to inflate or deflate the currency in order to deal with financial troubles, create a more favorable trading position, etc. Not being able to do these things can lead to serious problems. Imagine if you were a country with serious debts and a lagging manufacturing economy. It would really help to devalue your currency some. It makes your debts less valuable, and makes your manufactured goods cheaper for buyers. Now imagine you're in a currency union with a bunch of more economically successful countries and they don't want to devalue the currency. They want the currency strong, and tell you to pound sand. So now you're stuck with your debts getting bigger and bigger and your products getting less and less competitive and not a lot of options.",
            "Who would control the currency? Some would say the IMF or UN or similar. Those bodies are typically influenced by more powerful nations. A central world currency would be subject to manipulation to the benefit of the powerful and to the detriment of nations already lacking influence. Control of a nation's currency results in tremendous power and responsibility. Being able to set their own inflation and interest rates can build a nation or bring it to it's knees. Giving up that control is not to be taken lightly. One only needs to look at Greece as an example of what happens if a country moves to a centralized currency shared with other countries before it's ready. With major economic and corruption issues, Greece was forced into default on it's loans. Another country may have been able to print more money, causing inflation, but it would have allowed it to pay it's bills at the expense of the buying power of it's citizens. Greece, however, was unable to print more Euros on demand as they would have been able to do if they still used Drachmas.",

        "response": "This is due to the concept of airspeed vs. groundspeed, where the airspeed of the plane is much faster than the groundspeed, which is what our brains perceive as speed.",
        "gold_answer": [
            "There aren't any forces acting on your body that would make you feel that way, except for when you are accelerating to/from that speed. Every part of the airplane -- your seat, the floor, the air in the cabin -- is moving at the same speed as you are, so there is no way for your body to tell.",
            "The Earth is hurtling through the air at many times that speed. We feel acceleration and deceleration, a change in speed, and you definitely feel the acceleration for the first 20 minutes of the flight or so as you take off and ascend. That's why you stay in your seat! Your seat is attached to the plane so it's *pushing* you up to the speed. They get to that speed gradually so it's not too uncomfortable. But once you're at cruising speed and altitude, everything in the plane is moving at the same speed as the plane, so it's like your not moving at all. Speed is relative.",
            "The human body is not great at sensing speed in general, only acceleration. We have a bunch of senses that all work together to let us know when we're changing speed or direction, but we have to rely on context clues to get a sense of constant speed. The next time you're in a car (as a passenger) close your eyes while the driver is going a constant speed on a straight road. You'll notice that it won't feel different from sitting in a parked car. Your sense of speed in a car is largely dependent on seeing objects in the distance and seeing how you move relative to those objects. When you're in a plane, you don't get that kind of feedback. Even with a window seat, objects are so far away that we don't have a good concept of how fast we're traveling. When you're landing and taking off, you start to gain a sense of speed.",
            "Also parallax; all the items moving relative to you are either so foreign (clouds) or so far away (ground), it's difficult to judge how fast you're moving relative to them.",
            "You and the air inside the craft all accelerate with the aircraft. As long as the aircraft maintains a relatively steady speed, there are no forces acting on you that would indicate you are travelling fast. Then looking out the window at altitude, objects on the ground are so distant that you don't have a good reference to know how fast you are travelling. The best time to see how fast you are travelling as at takeoff and landing when you have a better reference as to your speed with objects on the ground.",
            "Because you don't feel velocity. You could be going a million miles an hour and you wouldn't know it. What you feel is acceleration, a change in velocity. On an ordinary plane flight, this occurs at the beginning (during takeoff) and at the end (during landing). You also feel it when the plane changes direction, which also requires a chance in velocity.",
            "Speed doesn't create a force - acceleration creates a force. That's also the reason why you don't feel the force of the earth rotating on its axis, or revolving around the sun at 30 km/second. What creates a force is a *change* in speed, which is what acceleration is. Picture yourself in a stopped car. You're going 0 miles an hour. Do you feel any forces? Not really, you're sitting still, things are good. Now imagine you slam on the gas pedal, going up to 60 mph. Now you feel a *force* because your speed is changing - your body is pressed backwards against the seat by that force. Now you hit 60 and you ease off the gas, maintaining a nice freeway speed. Do you feel any force while you're on the freeway? No, you feel just about the same as you did parked - if you opened a window you could feel the air moving, but inside of your car, everything is just the same as if you were going 0. Except now, slam on the brakes. You're decelerating and changing speed - a force pushes you forward, straining against the seatbelt. Once you hit 0, that force is gone. An airplane works the same way - you accelerate up to 600 mph slowly, so that the force isn't too overwhelming, but once you hit that speed and stop accelerating, it feels just the same as being still on the ground. Aside from any bumps or turbulence, which (just like in a car) change your acceleration by a little bit and affect you as forces.",
            "In an airplane, you don't have much of a frame of reference. The cabin is usually sealed off, so you don't experience the sensation of plane moving through air. Planes try to keep a pretty steady path. Which means you experience few forces due to acceleration once away from the airport. Planes fly pretty high off the ground. If you look out the window, you might be able to make out a few houses or cars at the ground level, moving pretty slowly across your massive plane of view. Their movement means nothing to you, thousands of feet above the ground or any other stationary object."

        "gold_answer": [
            "What would happen to the Earth? Probably nothing. If you made an instantaneous hole through the Earth and it wasn't being supported by anything, gravity would cause the solid core to fill the space immediately. The mantle will also fill in immediately. It would be like asking what would happen if you drilled a hole in the ocean. There might be a small earthquake that we can detect but that's about it. I'm not sure what will happen to the crust. Either you would have a very deep hole with a lava plug at the bottom, or a volcano. The earth has thousands of them, and the man made ones will probably be smaller than most, as it won't be over a hot spot or along a plate boundary. It would probably leak lava for a few days or weeks then stop and become extinct. Nothing that would affect very many people. If you could some how shield your hole to keep it form collapsing, nothing would still happen. The hole is too small and earth is too big. Gravity has to do with the mass of the planet, and the mass wouldn't change, or change by much, depending on what you did with the material in the hole, piled it up or simply disappeared it. The magnetic field also wouldn't be affected. Your hole is too small. If you had a hole a couple hundred miles across, you might get some of the apocalyptic effects you are looking for, but for a smaller hole, even one a mile wide, nothing exciting would happen.",
            "Simple answer: a perfect and in-destructible hole all the way to the core would start to spew hot liquified material through it. The gravity force on the outer layers would put pressure on the core which would force material through the hole. Edit1: I'm correcting myself based on the comments I have received. Edit1: The material might cool before it reaches the surface. That answer depends on the design of the hole. Edit1: Assuming the material did not solidify, the material would flow until is approximately reaches the surface. Once it gets close to the surface, the weight of the material in the column (hole) would balance out the gravitational pressure. There might be a bit of spew due to the momentum of the material. Since the core is denser than the rest of earth, on average, the material level would settle below earth's average surface. Edit1: I do not know if there is a place on earth where the surface is so far below the average that spewing core-material could happen. I would speculate something in the deepest trenches of the sea but that may not be the \"deepest\" place in this case. Since the earth diameter is smallest pole-to-pole then that might be \"deepest.\" Edit1: ~~Whether the material cools and seals the hole before raining death upon the planet is beyond me but I will speculate:~~ Edit1: ~~I would guess that, since the earth we still exist, then the hole would cool and seal up before raining massive destruction upon us. But...if the hole is insulated then there might be unimpeded flow to the surface.~~ Even if there is unimpeded flow to the surface, the next question would be whether the cooling at the surface caps the flow. ~~Again, since we still exist,~~ Since we still exist, the most likely answer is that the surface cooling would abate the flow.",

We aren't even sure what causes the magnetic field, one hypothesis is the [Dynamo effect]( URL_1 ), which basically says that the magnetic field is induced by the rotating liquid metal in the core. But addressing if the lava would spill out of the tunnel non-stop, the answer is no, at least from a hydrostatic point of view. Basically the pressure in the center of the Earth, that pushed the lava out would be countered by the weight of the lava column in the tunnel. The tunnel would fill up to the surface.",
            "Depends on the size of the hole, if its mahoosive, let's say big enough to remove 1/2 of the core, we'd get massive earthquakes and \"sink holes\" (if the stuff we excavate we put on the surface) or magnetic shifts due to the damage to the iron and nickel core.

I hate questions like this because you cannot simply ignore one aspect of physics and not another because there is a chain of processes that begin, well... at the beginning. It's like saying \"what would happen to my brain in space?... You know... Assuming I don't freeze or expand or burn and can breathe...\" What?! But anyway... If this hole were to magically occur it would depend on wether it occurs spontaneously or if the process took a long time, like with actual tools and machines. The diameter of the hole is also extremely significant because, as you know, the earth rotates and land migrates. If the size were, say, 2 miles in diameter then it would surely cause fantastic earthquakes, tsunamis, and cyclones because the tunnel will collapse upon itself within 56 hours. With the core exposed the level of radiation would actually be enough to terminate at least 40 percent of the populations and up to 70 percent depending on where the tunnel (or hole) is.",

The Earth's core is a ball of solid metal the size of the moon. The problem is that this ball is rotating slightly faster than the surface. The tunnel would be lodged firmly in the core and would appear to be moving at about 10 meters an hour, shredding the crust as it goes along, cutting through it like a knife, drawing two giant east-west circles at the surface points of the tunnels. There wouldn't necessarily be volcanic activity (think you're on a floating ice slab and you drill a line in it with a power tool - water still doesn't come out because you're still floating just like continents float on a giant lake of molten rock inside the Earth), but there would definitely be earthquakes and volcanos might still errupt if the pressure below the crust happens to be high enough.",

            "This is really a question better put to AskScience, but according to my geologist father, nothing would happen. First, a man-size hole (or even car- or house-size) would be infinitesimably small compared to the earth itself. It's like wondering why all the water in your skin doesn't run out of your pores. Second, such a hole, made the way you describe, would in effect be a continuing part of the surface (mathematically speaking), since you can't admit any part of the interior without destroying the hole. You would indeed require extremely strong tools and materials, greatly exceeding the capabilities of anything we have. If that was possible, and you were able to make the hole, then the hole would, for practical purposes, not be a hole into the earth, but a tunnel from one side to the other, around which the interior would flow (and not likely notice it, due to the enormity of comparative scale). And if you *did* admit the interior, the hole would immediately fill with whatever matter was at the level you admitted, and then cool solid at the top. You probably would get some lava and such at first, depending on where you do it, but it would seize solid soon enough, and you'd be left with an interesting feature. Unless, as others have suggested, the hole is extremely large, in which case, sure, it could be dramatic. But this is like asking what happens if you hit the earth with larger and larger stones. Somewhere between nothing and oblivion is a Michael Bay movie, but it's not especially interesting even as a thought experiement, since it only points to various points on the curve of possibilities, rather than frame a more interesting question with more variables.",
            "I have read a couple of books that had this scenario. It really depends on what kind of hole you're talking about. But here's the one I really remember: If you had a 3-foot diameter hole that went from one side of the earth, straight through the center to the other side, with an impervious material lining the walls of that hole, not much of anything would happen. if you then vacuum-sealed that hole, and put a near-frictionless car and rail system inside, you would have an extremely low-energy transport from one side of the earth to the other. It would be quite a fast trip, starting with the approximately 32.2 feet per second per second \"free fall\" acceleration, and gradually decreasing to the center, then gradually increasing to bring you to a cushy, 1g stop on the other side of the planet. This is entirely hypothetical, and completely undoable with today's technology. However, a hole that size through the center of the Earth would have negligible effect on anything else on the planet. Like sticking a hypodermic needle through the center of a grapefruit.",
            "As you probably know Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of molten iron in the Earth's core. Digging through the core would no doubt disrupt this motion, and weaken if not destroy our magnetic field. No magnetic field means almost certain extinction of life on Earth. Bummer. Assuming our magnetic field was left intact, the question of where the material from the hole would end up arises. Wherever it was, a lot of the Earth's mass would now be there, which might skew the Earth's gravitational pull. I'm not an expert so I'm probably wrong. I'd love to hear an answer from someone who knows what they're talking about though. Very interesting question indeed.",

            "I'm actually having a lot of fun with this, so I think this warrants a direct reply. First issue I see is that the cylinder would need to be filled with air. Some have suggested this would cause weather disturbances, and it might. I don't think it'd be big though. Assuming a 1m cylinder, the total volume would be about 0.08km3. That's pretty small, in terms of atmosphere. 1.0x10-9 % of the atmosphere. I'm not a meteorologist, but i don't think that'd cause anything other than a stiff wind for a while. This assumes a constant pressure, which is, of course, not realistic. The pressure is actually a bit of a monster. For curiosities sake, I'm playing with it. If you just do a straight exponential calculation, assuming the mechanics all the way down are the same as on the surface, you'd get 2.145x1013 kPa. That's 20 000 000 000 the surface pressure, and more than enough to create what's called a supercritical fluid. At those pressures, the gases would actually \"condense\", but not in the conventional sense. It's a very strange state of matter that's tough to ELI5. However, this is not the case. Earth is not a point mass, and the gravitational force pulling on the air column would not be constant. So I'll fiddle with the calculus a bit more for fun, and let you know what it comes out to. [EDIT: I worked it out as far as I could, but apparently I broke WolframAlpha trying to solve it. So we may be out of luck here.] As for the magnetic field, I did't read anything that'd say it would be an immediate issue. Our magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core, which is driven by tidal forces caused by the Sun. A 1m radius tube would likely not cause a significant disruption here. The core is a problem though. The dynamics of the inner core are not well know, but most geologists agree that it's a solid (some imply a highly compressed liquid that acts solid, and a few other theories, but solid core seems to dominate). So we've just drilled a hole through a solid core. A core that has a faster angular rotation than the surface. So one of two things would happen: either the core would continue to rotate, and we would lose the tube pretty quick, or the core would stop relative to the surface. Not imagine how much angular energy is stored in a rotating, massive, sphere of highly dense nickel-iron alloy. That would all need to go somewhere.I don't know exactly how it'd be dispersed, but it would be like trying to stop a huge flywheel, and the results would likely be catastrophic. Extinction event catastrophic. The last issue, all the rest aside, comes down to temperature and radiation. The Earth's core is in the ballpark of 4 000K (about 4 300C, or 7 800F). There is no known substance that could shield from that heat, or any cooling method to avoid melting/combusting pretty much anything thrown in. Then there's the radiation. I couldn't find any exact numbers on concentration, so it's tough to find an exact dose. However, the Earth as a whole is estimated to produce 20TW of radioactive energy. So I'll go out on a limb and guess that the level would be past the lethal dose for a person, and probably irradiate any inorganic object going through. Let's assume that all this is a non-issue, for fun. Just to examine the timeline of jumping in. Since we are ignoring the fatal pressures, temperatures, and the like, let's just assume a complete vacuum. The number most people use to traverse the diameter of the planet is about 42 minutes, which isn't too bad (This number would not be affected by equatorial bulge, and would not have any significant difference due to elevation changes. Height is not a variable in a perfect pendulum). You'd hit about 11 000m/s at the core, assuming constant acceleration (some people are saying 8 000m/s. Not the number I got, but either way, it's crazy fast). Now, as you probably know, a perfect pendulum will reach exactly the same height at which it was dropped. Same for you. The elevation variations in the Earth's surface vary by about 0.22%. Not enough to make a significant difference in travel time, but definitely enough to make an impact on your arrival. So you'd likely fall short and oscillate infinitely. If there was any source of energy loss, you'd eventually settle at the core, experiencing zero G. Doesn't sound fun to me. However, you would also have angular velocity. Since the radius of rotation decreases with the descent, your relative lateral velocity would increase, and you'd end up riding the side of the tube all the way down, like a slide. Even though it's straight down, you'd fall kind of like it's angled. By the time you hit the core, all of the lateral energy would be gone. As you ascended, you'd now have *less* angular velocity than the tube, and slide all the way back up. Obviously, all this friction is a huge problem, and would pretty much destroy any hope you had of reaching the other side, unless we extended the hypothetical to include a frictionless tube. TL;DR This would be a very bad thing. You'd either destroy the planet, waste a lot of resources for something that wouldn't last, or inevitably become stuck in the core of the Earth forever. So let's not build this, okay? EDIT: Please feel free to review my statements. What I've found is hardly the gospel truth. Some of the theories I referenced are not completely accepted, some of my math may be off, and some is wild speculation. I mostly did this because I answered a few points, started digging, and then this behemoth formed. Also, apologies for it not all being completely ELI5, or for what likely may be a few spelling/grammar errors. This was just done on the fly between classes.",

It would cause a lot of earthquakes as the continents shifted around these two points. Inner lawyers wouldn't have an issue because they tend to be much more fluid and can move around the hole.

I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles.

It comes about unexpectedly, one minute I have smelled the same smells for one hour and with a single breath I am introduced to a foreign scent without my approval. But sometimes I smell a smell I am expecting. Like my farts. I love the smell of my farts.",
            "for want of taste, smell is best compared to touch. a truly foul odor is very much like having a mild acid in your sinuses. courtesy of menthol and similar compounds in cleaning products, things that smell \"clean\" are best compared to a feeling of cold.",
            "It's a subtle bookmark for places and events that so instantly take you back to a memory. Smell is the nostalgic sense",
            "How had your loss of taste affected your diet? I've often wondered if it would improve ones diet if they could suppress thier taste senses, as it would (in my theory) eliminate any eating based on cravings.",
            "Many of the responses here deal with the emotional response that smelling something produces. I think that's good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there's still a link in the chain there that's missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I'm sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn't explaining anything that you don't already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that's just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I'm a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I'm keenly aware of them and they can't be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can't ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That's generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren't overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you're just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don't linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after.",
            "to smell is a gift and a curse at the same time. Overwhelming scents can be devastating such as a skunks spray while others such as the aroma of a fine wine can be uplifting.",
            "I read an article about a woman who had a magnet in planted in her finger. This resulted in a new sense where she could feel magnetic flieds (like microwave ovens, high voltage lines, etc.) and detect near by metal. Thinking about this completely alien sense helped me to consider my other senses more objectively. So being able to smell actually gives you information about the chemistry of objects. Consider all the chemical reactions that take place in cooking; they result in differnt smells (and tastes). Smell can also tell you if fruit and vegiyables are ripe or even spoiled. Likewise of meat goes bad it give off a smell - kind of a warning. So you can think of that as being smiliar to being able to see or hear that information - since you get it from a distance. It it probably more similar to hearing since it doesn't require direct or uninterrupted \"line - of - sight\". Off all my senses, smell is the one that most often conveys bad information. For like in the case of spoilage, the smell is revolting. Like a loud sound, or a bright light. Smell is a really strong trigger for memories too. For many people smelling cookies reminds them of home. Or maybe certain foods remind them of holidays. The part of the brain that processes olfactory (smell) information is closely associated with memories. Because smell gets stronger the closer you get to the subject, it often times draws me in for smells I like (good food, a woman with nice colonge, the smell of the woods, etc.), or drives me away for ones I dislike (spoilage, feeces, filth, body oder, too much fragrance, etc). As a parent of small children, smell is one way I know my kids needs a clean diaper. Often times he\\she will get cranky (audible) or show other visual signs. The smell is another queue. My mother in law has no sense of smell, so she would always stick a finger in the diaper to veifiy - which is messy. I just look when I am unsure. Generally speaking smell is a way we learn things not to eat. There are some poisons that are adapted to smell good or not at all, but very few things that smell bad that are good for you (individual tastes aside). So smell is just another way to collect information at a distance from the world around us. Most of that information can be collected other ways too. Especially if you took chemistry and have isolated different compounds and elemtents. Smell is just a convenient way to do that.. Edit: hit post early.",
            "A good smell is like feeling something very pleasant and soothing. It often elicits memories, as smell is very strongly tied to memory, and you may find yourself back in a happy childhood memory. The smell of bread in the oven would immediately transport your mind back to being a small child, helping your grandmother bake in the kitchen and feeling like the world was amazing and the day would last forever. It's a very visceral, all-over feeling when one is enveloped by a familiar, pleasant smell. You feel your body open up to pull it in, your eyes close and you salivate involuntarily, and everything around you slows just a little bit. Think of it a little like being in the afterglow of a good orgasm. Conversely, a bad smell is not as often tied with memory but creates a very physical response just the same. You'll feel your throat close as you gag, and your stomach churn or heave. The smell feels viscous and heavy in your mouth, as though it's tangible and you've bitten down on it. It seeps into you, burns a little, and feels thick and wet in your throat like you're choking on something slimy. Smelling something bad is like trying to swallow a mouthful of lukewarm eggwhites when you're already so full from eating that you're rather nauseated.",
            "Hey! I lost my sense of smell just a few years back, but I can still remember how things smell. It's kind of like closing your eyes and picturing something, but instead smell. As a note, I don't have full anosmia, I can still occasionally smell extremely strong scents (like a lot of cologne, or smoke) if they're right under my nose, on my upper lip.",
            "Smelling is like touching the texture of the air (a chemical texture), except there is a lot of different nuances, a little bit like different colours (except each person has about 400 \"primary odor\"). Also, if you stay a long time in the same odor, it disapears, you get used to it.",

            "The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit.",

Also if they deposit the cash from everyone's savings lets say 100k and the margin per contract is 5k per contract they can only buy or sell 20 contracts. I don't know what the FCOJ margins are, but if they trade more than 20 the profit goes to the exchange. At least that's how the CME rolls.",

They all look at the clock and then 9am (I think) strikes and crop report is read. Then they all panic because they need to unload whatever they bought and finding the 2 buying they sell ASAP. Again how can these 2 buy everything with so little money? 3. Finally the closing bell strikes and trading stops. How did all this scheme happen so fast ? Doesnt trading happen 9:30am to 4pm at NYSE (why wtc was shown?) for such commodities. Did they spend that many hours there? It just seemed sudden and abrupt the time flow.",

In reality I think it would've been the firm that they trade through and that provided them the loan in the first place. (margin call means pay back the loaned amount) edit: maybe I had it backwards and the dukes were going to go long on OJ futures, but it's the same principle. margin call did them in after the market worked against them based on their false knowledge.",

            "Alright, sit yo ass down and get ready for a story. The TLDR is indeed ratings and production cost. But if that's the why, we must ask ourselves \"why now?\" What happened to these stations, and why did it all happen at the same time? Well, the seed of change (or pestilence if you wanna be poetic) is TLC. Before The Channel Formally known as Learning gave us child beauty pageants and whatever the fuck Honey Boo Boo is supposed to be. You see, in 2007 Discovery was kind of in a hole. As you may know Discovery owns, TLC, Nat Geo, Animal Planet and more. Despite their wide net, the brand was tanking. So they brought in a man from NBC (who would soon sell out to Comcast) to liven things up. The Discovery Channel store was closed, the main station started doing documentaries more fit for history channel with \"True crime\" exploitation pieces. This would in turn hemorrhage viewership from History (A sister network of A & E) who began showing programs like Gangland. Modern Marvels (which had existed since 1995) got a shiny update, and the content of the History Channel become the closest content rival for Discovery. But then, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, or more accurately here comes TLC's shit shows. Ya see, part of the way Discovery was able to have so many networks was appealing to different demos for each one. History had been nailing the males over 40 crowd and discovery had been shooting for educated younger males. TLC was basically discovery channel marketed to women in their early 20s to early 30s, and you know what bored women of that age-range were watching? Soaps, MTV/VH1 reality shows and celebrity gossip. Taking a \"documentary\" series about child fashion shows and editing it like an MTV reality show with a healthy bit of exploitation (the fans of these shows are watching to laugh at these people, make no mistake) and they suddenly had a the right ingredients for what would become a network of cheep, exploitative, schlock across all Discovery Networks (well, except the Science Channel). So What really happened? What really changed? Demographics. Say what you will about these networks being crap, they do a good job of not internally fighting with each other for attention. The Honey Boo Boo crowd doesn't want much to do with \"are Megladon's still around\" the age range, income level, and general education of the demo they're trying to reach can be reliably expected to enjoy the TV click bait. They figured out something Buzzfeed did before you wanted to inexplicably punch it in the face: people don't want to learn, they want to have what they know and like confirmed. This is how Discovery Channels' most profitable stretch, year after year, is telling people sharks aren't violent murder machines (except when they are but it's okay because not to people) like it's the first time anybody has heard this information. Apologies to Shark Week fans, but how surreal is it that the most educational thing on the network is telling a demographic that didn't grow up with Jaws shit they already know from last year? And then there's history channel. History is, again, owned by A & E not discovery. History is a tougher nut to dissect. In short, as they became more direct competition for Discovery they began duplicating what was making discovery successful. Deadliest Catch became Ice Road Truckers, bad speculative science docs became Ancient Aliens. History duplicated the pacing of TLC and marketed it to men, but dumbed its content down to turn the stuff with potential to be good into a filter for Discovery Channel's scraps. A & E went the way of TLC and now theirs no real market incentive to change. If you really want to know whose to blame, look in the mirror. The original demographics have moved on. We're watching Netflix and are simply too educated to watch a show about convergent mermaid evolution. Discovery says they're gonna start making quality programming again, so demand might be returning as Millennials get more disposable income (Oh right, the other big reason! Because of the whole recession thing, cheaper shows became a must and Gen-Xers aged 34-48 had more money than the groups they were, on paper, marketing towards so include this disclaimer in the paragraph about TLC's market shift) and educated young people starting families in their late 20s is presenting itself as a important demographic to snag. In short: The Economy tanked around the same time as the networks underwent massive internal restructuring. Networks that were in mild competition with each other entered a full race to the bottom and neither one went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.",

            "There is a gigantic misconception among people that the Constitution gives us civil rights. As the Declaration of Independence says:  > We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In other words:  > It is obvious to all of us that every human being is born equal, and that all of us are born with certain fundamental rights that cannot be taken away; some, but certainly not all, of these rights are the right to be alive, the right to be free, and the right to choose how to live your life. The Constitution does not give us our human rights -- they're granted to us upon birth by God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever you believe to be the source of fundamental truth. Everyone has these rights. American or foreign, bad people, good people, your worst enemy. Saints, criminals, murderers -- everyone is born with fundamental rights and they *cannot be taken away* by human beings, because who are we to remove a gift bestowed by God? Because these rights are inherent, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights don't provide them; rather, the documents provide *prohibitions on the government* from infringing on the exercise of these fundamental rights we are all born with. The Founders believed that the best government would be one that honored and protected its citizens natural rights. Now, some infringement of our rights is necessary to provide for social welfare and order, but even here, it's more about balancing the exercise of our rights; e.g., when you deny a criminal his right to freedom in order to protect other people's right to live free of physical harm. These rights are distinct in the Constitution from the Privileges  &  Immunities of citizenship, which *are* the things that we are granted as Americans. These include things like the entitlement to vote, to travel freely between states, and to have free access to commercial markets. These privileges *are* granted by the government and *can* be taken away. The Constitution recognizes the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. So, yes, illegal immigrants have that fundamental right -- they were born with it, just as you are. However, as I said, the Founders and the Constitution recognize that complete anarchy leads to greater infringement on human rights (because the strongest just takes over as tyrant), so the government is allowed enact reasonable regulations that infringe on fundamental rights to the extent that they are necessary to protect social order and welfare. One of the infringements that's reasonable is prohibiting noncitizens from owning firearms -- it is reasonable for a nation to protect itself by preventing armed foreigners from roaming free within its borders.",
            "While many whip themselves into a lather, over the mistaken notion that illegal aliens are essentially given all the same rights and privileges as citizens, under our Constitution, it is important to point out that their guaranteed rights are not exactly the same as citizenship: Their protections stem from Section One, of the Fourteenth Amendment: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive **any person** of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to **any person within its jurisdiction** the equal protection of the laws.\"",
            "To buy a gun legally from an authorized FFL, you need to either be a citizen or have a green card. So, no, you don't have second amendment rights as an illegal.",
            "There are numerous laws which prohibit the possession of a firearm while in the commission of a crime. Illegal aliens by their very act of being here are committing an ongoing crime every second they're in the US without permission, hence being in the United States illegally and possessing a firearm is illegal.",
            "This is a case where there are some mixed decisions from federal courts. Some courts have found that illegal immigrants do have a right to bear arms, but many have not. The 7th Circuit, for example, found in 2015 that they do have a right to bear arms, but that a federal law prohibiting them from possessing firearms was somehow valid. Don't ask me how they figured that one. The 4th, 5th, and 8th Circuits have ruled that they do not have that right. What does that mean? It means this is a case that will likely be resolved eventually by the US Supreme Court."

Look at at writing or at a clock. Note what the writing says or what time it is. Look away. Look back. If the writing is different, or the time is more than a few seconds off, you're dreaming. 2. Trace your steps back as far as you can. In a dream – even an extremely vivid, lucid one – you get stuck at some point and can't remember anything before that. While awake, you can trace your whole day back to when you woke up in your bed, then the day before, then the week before, etc. 3. Ask yourself if you're in a dream. Concentrate on your surroundings. Even if you're in a familiar place, is it how you remember it being? Are the physics around you the same? What about the behavior of those around you? 4. Hold your breath for as long as you can. If you can go on without feeling the urgent demand for air, you're dreaming. If you *are* dreaming and realize it, then you are in a [lucid dream]( URL_0 )! Go nuts, have fun, do whatever you want!

            "A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, it's certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google \"Xenu\" or \"Thetans\". There's a fairly recent book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it's gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you. But with so much social media these days I think they've had a hard time applying pressure on-line like they used to. **TL;DR** - It's mostly crazy bullshit, but *profitable* crazy bullshit.",
            "Well, not to speak on the actual religion's dogma (as most religions when examined are usually odd beliefs), the reason for controversy is the level of control they try to exert over their members, ex-members, and anybody who tries to criticize them. The means by which they have done this at times have been considered at a minimum, highly unethical or moral, or just plain illegal. They have been accused of fostering a \"cult-like\" mentality among their members.",

            "For much of the postwar 20th century, if you were a young white man with at least a high-school education, you had to try *not* to get a job that would fund at least a lower-middle-class lifestyle. If you had a college degree in *anything*, even English or Art History, you were pretty much guaranteed a lifetime of desk jobs, each higher-paying and more powerful than the last, with The Firm, which would then take care of you through retirement with a pension. If you came into The Firm with a Bachelors, it might actually pay your time *and your tuition* for a Masters. When you went home at the end of the night, work was generally over - there was no email. Calling someone at home was a big deal and used mostly for emergencies. (This era is largely where the perception that the unemployed are just lazy comes from. There really was a time when you had to be lazy to be unemployed.) Nowadays, you need to get into a good elementary school that will prepare you to work hard in middle school so you can take the right classes in high school to get into a good college in a handful of the \"right\" majors, and then maybe go to graduate school, to stand a *chance* of getting a good job if you're also a friendly/interesting person who interviews well. Outside a handful of labor markets, your health insurance and retirement plans will be token benefits (if they exist at all). You'll need to hit the streets, blast your resume around, write a ton of cover letters, and practice your interview game so you can change jobs every few years to increase your salary with your experience. Employers certainly aren't handing out meaningful raises just for showing up. Your bosses may expect you to answer your cell phone or respond to texts/emails promptly late into the night. For blue-collar workers, much of this can be attributed to globalization and automation. For white-collar workers... as just one example, many corporations needed what was basically database functionality long before databases existed. A whole lot of middle-class lives were funded to replicate what I can now do for 15 minutes of setup and $5/month: Postgres on a virtual machine. It also turns out that people in low-cost-of-living countries are just as good at a lot of menial computer-operating tasks. Firms are also getting more and more efficient. It turns out that a lot of the time, you can lay off an entire layer of people who do nothing but have meetings with each other all day and the firm makes just as much money. You can have a \"corporate culture\" of \"passionate\" people who work 10 more hours a week for the same salary and hire 20% fewer of them.

            "In the US young people have the problem of a changing nature of labor and the contract between worker and corporation. In past few decades wages have not increased with respect to ~interest rates~ inflation, in many ways they have decreased. This means we get a larger number in terms of dollars from the companies we work for, but we receive far less value for our work. So we have to work more. We work for smaller firms generally, shops and retail, tinier operations that make unionizing and collective bargaining less viable strategies for supporting our labor's value. A major reason for the existence of unions was to combat the spreading de-humanization of work, which simply put took satisfaction out of labor and alienated people. Additionally, they helped support labor in national politics. By and large people born in the past 20 years will never join or support a union, and won't be able to offer each other support for their livelihoods. This means goods are slightly cheaper, but labor is cheaper still, so we have to work more to stay solvent. Gains in women's rights and expanded diversity have slightly offset the effects of wage stagnation, but the crisis of 2008 shows us that we won't get back to the state of the mid-90s labor. The minimum wages your parents worked for briefly as youths are the wages you will work for until you are middle-aged, when you briefly make more and then get fired and have to work for minimum wages again (on average). In the past century our labor has become a substantial portion of our identities. If you write a story about someone, the thing they spend time doing to make money is probably the first thing you use to describe them. This is Jim, an accountant, or Mary, an engineer, or Sanjeet, a flight attendant, etc. Well, now your profession will last 15 months, on average. You will change jobs many times in your lifetime as a replaceable cog in a variety of machines that don't care about you. Oh, and you won't be able to retire on the average person's wages. You'll get no pension, and once you are fired for being less productive than a computer the company you worked for will forget you ever existed. All your work will have your name scrubbed from it and your impact on the world will be indistinguishable from the person in the cubical next to yours (on average). edit: Thank you DrunkHacker.",

Or you'd go into a public profession(cop, garbage man, street cleaner) because you wanted to make your city better, and there wasn't necessarily the stigma attached, because not everyone went to college, so everyone was on a more level field. I think the choices people have now, coupled with stigmas associated with occupations, and growing inequality(rich people used to have the same things as poor people, just better, now rich people have options poor people have no idea even exist).",

I mean aside from the sucky things that are happening now, such as great recession, and HIV/AIDS, which were not really problems for older generations, for the most part we do have it better. Our life spans are longer, infectious disease transmission is down, malnutrition is going down, etc. Obviously there are and will be exceptions to these things in certain places, but for the most part, life is comparably good. Subjectively, we often see things as being better in the past, the so called \"rose-tinted glasses.\" Don't entirely believe me and think it is a recent development that kids and teens are assholes, check out [this quote and it's author]( URL_0 ).

            "I think this is a misconception about our generation. We are spoiled and arrogant in a lot of ways and we talk like we're the most important generation ever, but I don't often hear anyone saying the old generations had it easier. We're very aware that having to deal with the depression, WWII, Korea, Nam, and many other things must have sucked way worse than anything we've been through. If you go back further, it sucked even worse. I can't even imagine getting drafted and forced to go kill people and probably die in WWII, or even worse Viet Nam. Iraq has been pretty messed up, but there was no draft and far less American deaths than previous wars. One thought I often have about these generation discussions is how we are all quite the same. Human beings do not inately change from one generation to the next, we just respond to our environment. Whatever our strengths or flaws, the previous generation has made us what we are, so we should try to get along. When your grandson has stretched our ear lobes, wears all blacks, spraypaints the city, and won't get a job, it's a little bit your fault, so don't hate him too much.

Back in the day, you didn't have to worry about kids pulling ahead you who live 5000 miles away. Today, they compete with you. Why choose you, when employers can hire someone in India to do the same thing for much less? Less manual intensive jobs are available today. Companies don't need so much manual labor today, as they did 30 years ago. If they do need a labor intensive job to get done, it is sent east to East Asia for cheap labor. This is true for things like manufacturing and assembly. More jobs are automated in general. You don't always need people to get the job done. You can get a computer to do the same thing. Why call up a travel agent when you can go to Priceline or Expedia? Self checkout lines? Basically what I'm saying is that there were more (good) employment opportunities back in the day.

            "When we talk about that we're talking about the post war generations. A few things happened in America that was completely unprecedented. One, most the the industrialized world was in ruin except for the United States, this led to a large number of high paying private manufacturing jobs. Two the United States vs. the Soviet Union made it necessary for large government expenditure and expansion, this also created jobs. Three, women retreated from the work force after the war creating more demand for labor. These three things made it extremely easy to find good paying work. Now, lets look at housing. Housing cost from post war until about 1975 rose, roughly, with inflation. In the mid 70s the price of housing started to outpace inflation, this has accelerated so that a house in 1970 that would have cost 100k(adjusted for inflation) would have cost 200k in 1990, and today that exact same house would run half a million. These are national numbers, there are certainly places in America where this isn't the case, but it's true in most places. Next is education. I'll keep this one easy. In 1960 it cost roughly $9500 in inflation adjusted dollars to attend an ivy league school. It now costs over $40,000. That's quadrupling of tuition, the price of books and the aforementioned housing has also gone up significantly more. Well, there's three factors. There's more, but you get the jist of it.",

She lost her life to breast cancer, but not before she spoke out about signs and symptoms on every television program she could. Makeup maven Estee Lauder was also touched by breast cancer. She started the original ribbon campaign. The awareness campaign was started by women suffering from breast cancer who knew that if they had known what to look for they would have gotten treatment years earlier, and maybe not died of it.

A good awareness campaign was the ALS ice bucket challenge. You didn't need to pay anyone to do it (other than ice and bucket providers, I guess) and you would donate directly to research instead of to professional awareness campaign managers like Komen.

And has the most successful marketing plan, think about it, how many \"specific cancer\" months can you name most of the big ones have a month but none with the prevalence of breast cancer. Women in the USA make far more purchasing decisions than Men so it is not a stretch to think that buying power hasn't reached to charitable endeavors as well. So breast cancer has high visibility, and I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, just that it, is, a thing. The fact of the matter is that raising breast cancer awareness can be an effective vehicle for general awareness of all cancers.

            "I'll say something other than the conspiracies (however much truth there may be) here. Awareness is so much more than making someone aware of beat cancers mere existence. Awareness is about knowing and recognizing the signs in yourself and others, so that the disease can be detected early, and thus be more easily treated. For example, I bet most people who have heard of breast cancer haven't heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It's a rare form of breast cancer that forms in sheets instead of lumps. By the time it's detectable as a misshapen breast, is usually already at stage 4. Another example is that men can and do get breast cancer. Most men don't realize this, and would have absolutely no idea how to monitor for it. That's another part of awareness: knowing who is at risk. Most people only know that lumps = breast cancer. But there are many kinds that manifest in different ways. Awareness helps (or should) people understand more about the disease, not just make them aware that it exists. This should be the case for most cancers, but breast cancer gained traction due to its prevalence in modern America, and organizations like SGK getting the word out. P.S. Try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when talking about breast cancer awareness. There are shady people trying to profit off it, sure, but there are also a lot of people out there who this cause is very important to, and are trying to help with nothing but the best intentions. My sisters and I are considering starting a charity for IBC awareness and research, in honor of our mother who died from it. We've already hosted a few fundraisers whose proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. There are people out there trying to help. I'm one of them.

If you get frequent checks you might prevent cancer or find it at a point that it can be removed. Terminal cancer is often found too late and could have been prevented. Since the awareness month and company campaigns, breast cancer deaths HAVE went down, and prevention has went up. That result is good and has saved the life's of your mothers, sisters, and wife's. So what if komen pays its ceo 85% of all the earnings. Some companies focus on awareness and the promotion of the message instead of actual research and that does result in life's saved. All it takes is that pink shirt or commercial to get that stubborn woman to get a check. Plenty of other companies over pay their CEOs and higher up while doing nothing for the community and saving no life's. Look at the positives, and if you know the facts, donate to different charities like the research programs themselfs but don't ask for the abolishment or harass the ones like komen, because without them we have a lot less awareness and advertisement.

            "Seems like there are many cynics out here. It's true there are many parasitic organizations that capitalize on our charity and good will, but the fact is that breast cancer is one of the many cancers where death is preventable if caught in early stages. This is alongside cervical (get your pap smears at 21 ladies, and HPV vaccines for everyone), prostate for men (older men should do digital rectal exams), and of course lung (stop smoking). It's a little unfair to say that breast cancer is the only one getting awareness when all these other cancers are also getting attention. I think breast cancer was the first big movement because you are able to do a self-exam and that is empowering to women, so it is now the biggest (btw the main reliable screening tool is regular mammographies, so self-exams are a start, but not sufficient). Just to provide a scale of the problem, more than 50% (a half!) of women will develop a benign breast lesion. Fortunately most of these are not lethal and should not progress to a malignancy. More than 10% of women will develop a true malignancy, where your odds of survival are almost exponential the earlier you catch it. So it's kind of important to make it common knowledge how to find a lump in your breast, because there's a chance that it might kill you. That's not to deny the aforementioned parasitic organizations. I guess the best advice is find a good charity of your choice and ignore the bad ones, but don't hate on the movement as a whole because it is trying to make a difference for the American public.",

But now what do you do with the organization they built up? For something like breast cancer awareness, their mission is complete. The public at large knows about it, and pays attention to the changing recommendations about it. But are they going to just tell their staff \"Alright everybody, we won! Show's over, you're all fired.\" Of course not - The people working here will \"Goal creep\" and look for new things to do to legitimize their organization.

            "The Komen Foundation is getting a lot of flak ITT, as they should, but I think most people are not answering your question, which might be better understood as, \"Why does the Komen Foundation behave as it does?\" It is because of the difficulty of funding non-profit organizations. As you might be aware, most non-profit organizations have to divide their resources between administration and their cause. What you might not be aware of is that a lot of the administrative costs go toward finding more funding. Unless a non-profit has a stable stream of income from committed donors, grants, or an endowment, every non-profit is in constant pursuit of more sources of revenue. This often means hiring a professional grant writer and hosting some sort of open house or gala that informs and solicits donors. Even stable non-profits will probably be constantly pursuing more revenue to further their cause and expand their programs. The Komen Foundation decided to try a for-profit marketing campaign in order to get revenue. The people they hired advised them to have an ambitious advertising campaign with the justification that it would bring in a lot more revenue than it cost. It cost a ton of money but it was wildly successful, so they have kept it up and followed those strategies. The obvious downside is that an inappropriately large percentage of their budget goes toward marketing, which increases awareness but does not create a cure. The upside however, is that they have raised more funds for their cause than they would have otherwise.",

And on top of that Karen G Komen earns 684,000 dollars a year that seems like one hell of a lot of money for a non profit organisation. I refuse to support them anymore, untill they straighten out their act i wont donate, if Karen G Komen went down to a small pitiful sallary like say 60,000 dollars a year that wouldnt bother me, but over half a million a year for doing what? having your name on a non profit organisation that makes you rich, fuck off bitch i hope you catch fire and die.",
            "This is a two-fold answer for me. 1: 'Awareness' is a euphemism for money. Ideally research money, but people make a profit on the research as well. When you say you are raising money, it puts people off. When you say you are raising awareness, people are more likely to be involved because their is not cost. 2: Saying you are raising awareness allows people who make no physical contribution to feel like they are doing something important, when all they are doing is sharing something on social media. They are \"raising awareness\" and pat themselves on the back, when really they are just being arm-chair activists. That is not a bad thing. You can't make concrete contributions to every cause, so promoting others is good, but too often I think people believe if they click 'like', they are doing something other than easing their conscience.",
            "Putting aside any ulterior motive companies that may or may not profit from, my literal eli5 would be: Reminding people of a problem that many people face may seem bad, but reminding them that they should check the area regularly, can help fix* the problem sooner. Like when adverts remind us to fill in tax returns, we all know about it but can easily ignore it. So being reminded will keep it in out minds to do it sooner. It also helps make it less scary for some people, knowing that their not alone and others that may not be in their situation can talk knowledgeably or aid helpfully. (*'fix' is subjective, but this is eli5. 'Not die' is best outcome of worst case)",
            "It's partly because of pandering. There are many types of cancer that affect both sexes that are more prevalent and deadlier than breast cancer but it's a way for people to show support for womens causes and so it gets a lot of attention. Prostate cancer is just as deadly and many men die from it each year yet very little is done about it from a fundraising perspective. This can be argued because it's a cancer that affects privileged men VS under privileged women. Supporting womens causes is seen as progressive. Supporting mens causes or equal right causes is seen as misogynistic to some. To put it another way, all the hype around breast cancer awareness is just a kind of reverse sexism.",
            "It's billions of dollars. Raising awareness comes down to three things: 1) collect more money 2) fly all over the world with rich accommodations at 5 star resorts, personal drivers, lavish meals all paid for by your donated dollars 3) suing anyone and everyone who uses a shade of pink too similiar (within 10 shades) of their own, or uses the word \"cure\" in anything. A certain pink charity spends more money every year suing people for trademark transgression that most charities have to spend each year on their mission. Their CEO makes somewhere just shy of $750,000 a year",
            "Two things People do donate more to causes that they see. We all know what mcdonalds is, why do they advertise? It's similar logic to that. Everyone knows what breast cancer is, but you're more likely to donate if its shoved in front of your face. Two things: Charities make money, they run a lot of things that give no money to actual research, but can still say they are donating to the cause of increasing awareness. This seems lame but is one of the reasons that \"awareness\" is talked about so much.",
            "Was developing a website once that wanted to include the breast cancer awareness pink branding mumbo jumbo. When we contacted them about involving them in the site they immediately began the discussion by saying there would legal action of we used it without their permission and to get their permission we had to guarantee $10,000.00 in donations each month. If donations didn't reach that level the company had to make up the balance. Shook my head and laughed, never spoke to them again. Felt very dirty dealing with them.",
            "Big cancer is one of the most profitable industries. They employ mostly volunteers, produce little in the means of ribbons, flyers, and shirts. Probably their biggest overhead is commercials and other advertising. The pink breast cancer ribbon campaign you're speaking of donates a very small percentage of their profits. I've read as little as 3%. It's not about perpetual awareness as much as it is perpetual profits. These \"charities\" should be audited quarterly and their giving should be made public.",
            "All cynicism aside, it's like most advertising. Does anyone not know about McDonalds or Pappa Johns at this point? No, but they need reminding to invest money in their products. Similarly, these \"awareness\" efforts are to promote a cause and ask you to invest money (donating to research or testing ideally) or effort (getting yourself tested) into the cause. As silly as the \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" was, there was a sharp rise in donations to ALS societies from that campaign.",
            "As with everything, it's all about money sadly. Also If I want to donate I will donate to an actual research facility, or to cancer patients themselves, not some for profit company. Plus everyone(in the us at least) knows about breast cancer in women. Since these campaigns only are about spreading \"Awareness\", they need to start spreading awareness about men with breast cancer. Which I've literally never heard and of the big companies bring up.",
            "I don't know if you're a comedy fan or not, but Doug Stanhope actually has a great bit about charities and \"raising awareness\". It was in his special, Beer Hall Putsch. Basically, he talks about how a lot of these charity awareness-raising organizations only donate like a fraction of a cent of their proceeds towards actual research, and the rest is spent on more promotional material and salaries for the bosses.",
            "Profits. Most organizations that \"raise awareness\" keep the money while donating about 1% of raised funds to actual research. Remember these companies do not care about a cure. They are in cahoots with Big Pharma who will openly admit they are not in business to find cures, but rather create medicines to offset symptoms that will require people to use their medicine for the rest of their lives.",
            "For the Breast Cancer cause, their biggest friend is visibility. These endorsements by, say, the NFL, bring in a lot of money for them. And political clout. Some Breast Cancer charities go as far as [trying to shut down other, smaller cancer charities, for infringing on their copyright.]( URL_0 ) The Susan Komen Foundation is trying to shut local charities down for using the word \"Cure\" .",
            "There is a huge financial benefit. You should see the salaries paid at the Susan G. Komen foundation. Good rule of thumb if a charity spends a good portion of its money \"raising awareness\" they are pretty damn close to a scam. We are not going to cure cancer by telling somebody about especially when everybody already knows about it.",
            "There's a huge financial benefit, just not always for breast cancer. I try to only buy from or donate to causes that I know will actually give the money to research and treatment. it's hard to actually find out if those companies are legit or not (I am not a fan of komen for this very reason).",
            "It's the oldest form of karma-farming. Start a 'foundation' with a tear-jerker rationale. Set yourself as the director with a fat salary. Pass-along residual donations to 'The Cause'. Try to keep your salary 80-90% of foundation income. Everyone thinks you are a swell dude, but you are really just a con man.",
            "The same reason there's a retail financial industry. The same reason there's religion. Because there's a limitless supply of interest from people who are terrified about their health, looking for something, anything they can do about it, even if the right answer is far simpler than what's on offer.",
            "Well, with the pink NFL garbage its all about revenue, almost nothing is donated. With the pink ribbon \"for the cure\" pennies from every dollar are donated, the majority goes to salaries and advertising and marketing. If you want to actually help, don't give your money to \"charities\".",

            "Raising awareness doesn't mean that you are literally telling someone that something exists. It is to remind people that something exists and that there are things they can do (in this case donate money, check themselves for lumps, have regular checkups at the doctor... )",

            "I'm actually very disappointed that \"public awareness\" doesn't seem to give a shit about skin cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, bone marrow cancer in comparison. I wonder what the funding/charity disparity is.",

            "I worked at a food production facility and it's cool how much effort went into knowing the answers to this type of question. Every ingredient in a product that ends up for sale is considered and chosen for that recipe based on freshness dates. If certain ingredients are not as fresh then the 'sell by' date is changed. Potato salad with all fresh ingredients gets, say, three days on the shelf before the mayo goes off. That's basically universal, so extended shelf life means added salts, maybe sugar or vinegar but usually salt. So if your local deli has takeout potato salad and they say it's good for 2 days refrigerated and Wal-Mart has a tub of it but it's good for 6 days and we can assume similar ingredients ( they don't have magic mayo ) then it's a guarantee the extra 4 days come from the massive amount of added salt.",
            "There are a few different dates that get put on food, and they have different meanings. **Sell by** - mostly meaningless to consumers. A note for the store to discard the food after this date, but it's often a week or more before the food goes bad. Ignore this date, or add a week to it. Your milk probably has this date on it. **Best before** - a note for the customer. Quality can't be 100% guaranteed after this date, so you can't sue if it's not up to par, but it's still edible. **Use by** - this is a real one, but it only means quality may degrade after this date. If it smells okay, it's likely still safe. However, all of the above applies to ***unopened*** food. Once you open it, you introduce bacteria and humidity, and if you don't store it properly the date on the package doesn't matter. There are different ways food goes \"bad\" once it's opened: - **Stale/dry:** The flavor or texture is changed by the air. It doesn't taste the best, but it's not bad for you. - **Rancid:** Oils go bad. Some oils are prone to going bad from oxygen, heat, and light. Not only do they taste and smell bad, but they can chemically harm your body. - **Contaminated:** Bacteria grow when there's water or moisture. The bacteria can make you sick, and many bacteria (like botulism) make toxic wastes. Cooking it well kills the bacteria, but cooking won't get rid of the toxins. - **Moldy:** Fungus grows when there's moisture. If you see fuzzy mold or weird colors *anywhere* on the food, it's everywhere in the food. Throw it out. Now, back to the milk. The date on the carton is likely the \"sell by\" date, not an expiration date. Once it's home, add a week to get a better expiry date. Regardless of the date, if you haven't opened it yet, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. If you opened it in the past week and kept it in the fridge, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. It's been in the fridge open for more than a week... bacteria may have gotten in. Pour a bit into a cup and give it a smell. Your nose is good at detecting when something is off. **If it smells ok, it's probably good to cook with.** Cooking will kill off any bacteria and reset the expiration date. Cooking will likely fix stale or dry food too. You can put stale tortilla chips in the oven and they'll be good as new. You can cook with milk beyond its date if it smells fine. **If it looks or smells weird or gross, don't cook with it.** Cooking can kill bacteria, but it can't get rid of the toxic wastes from the bacteria or fungus, and it can't fix any rancid oils. However, you should know that if you're immune system is suppressed (old, very young, pregnant, or otherwise vulnerable to infection) then you should definitely keep to the printed \"use by\" dates and don't eat things after a few hours at room temperature or a few days in the fridge. This stuff may be lightly contaminated but still safe for most people, but it may be dangerous if your immune system can't handle the extra bacteria. You can still cook with it if you cook it thoroughly, but just be cautious.",
            "Somewhere in-between. The milk is no longer plain milk, it has combined with other ingredients in new combinations, and been cooked (which kills bacteria). But there are so many variables in the milk, the other ingredients, cooking time, and so on, that it's tough to set a new expiry date.",
            "In that case, you've heat killed the bacteria and other harmful pathogens that could grow in it. Chemically, the milk reacts with the other ingredients resulting in a new mixture that may or may not be sustainable for pathogens.",
