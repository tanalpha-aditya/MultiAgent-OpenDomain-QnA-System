This is apparent in how the Federal Senate was initially chosen by the state legislatures (prior to a constitutional ammendment), and the Electoral College was initially also selected independent of the popular vote (that's screwy ATM because of state-level laws). Indeed, the House of Representatives still gets 0 say in federal nominations, appointments, or treaties. As the State governments were viewed to be much closer and more relevant to the People, their state constitutions generally reflected this in directly voting in many more positions.\",\n",

The important thing to know is that is that water is MOST dense at about 4 degrees C. The reason for this has to do with the shape of the water molecule, but that's not necessary to answer the question. As water gets colder, approaching this temperature, it tends to sink, so the water at the bottom of, say, a big lake, is going to be that temperature.

However the Water molecules are further apart when they are in the Solid state compared to the liquid state. It has to do with the geometry of the H2O molecule. That's why at 0ºC Ice as a density of 0.9 (Water is 1). So when you increase the pressure and force the water / ice molecules to be even closer they pass to a state where they can be even closer: liquid. **EDIT**: I know this is not a proper graphic. It's an illustration. Even if it had a scale it would be useless: engineers use Equations of state because we need to know partial pressure at different points of pressure and temperature (It's like knowing how much of the water goes to moisture / humidity.

Carbonated liquids like coke shown in the video above are under pressure in the bottle due to the carbon dioxide gas that tries to escape the liquid. this lowers the freezing point until you release that pressure with the satisfying \"TSHHHHHT\" you hear when opening a bottle or can. This causes the freezing point to raise and it freezes before your eyes. Fun fact, the reason why ice is more slippery the warmer it is is purely because the pressure of you walking on it melts the ice a little bit.

Second of all, water freezes from top to bottom, and most of the salt leaves the water as it freezes, which makes the water around the ice saltier. This has two effects: first, it lowers the freezing point, and second, it makes the water denser, such that it sinks to the bottom of the ocean.

As ice forms in salt water the salt molecules are squeezed out creating less salty ice which floats and a salty slurry that sinks.

       "    \"The legislative branch makes laws. The executive branch executes those laws. The judicial branch considers whether actions taken by the executive branch or laws written by the legislative branch are constitutional. In executing the laws, the executive branch has an interpretation and certain resources. For example, a law might be created to institute something like the FCC, whose head is nominated by the president and follows the president's orders. The president needs some way to tell the various departments and bureaus what to do, so he uses executive orders. There is nothing wrong with executive orders. You just need to understand what they do. All they do is to give instructions on how to handle cases requiring regulatory approval or oversight within the bounds of the responsibility of that department as assigned by congress. If they overstep the bounds, then the action can be challenged in court. If the dept. itself is unconstitutional (for example, congress creates a department of religious affairs to say what religions can and can't be practiced) then it will be challenged in court. An executive order is not unconstitutional until declared unconstitutional by the courts. Despite what conservatives would have you believe about Obama's executive orders. I don't necessarily agree with what Trump is doing, but he's well within the law on this.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm a presidency scholar, so I can answer this pretty well. In inhibiting executive action, there are four really key things. The first is that the POTUS is not the Executive. By that I mean that the man signs the thing, but the institution must do any of the actions. If, for instance, Trump wakes up cranky and decides, by executive order, to have arrested on sight anyone who makes fun of him, many will simply not do it. Their reasons for disobedience will vary from moral to legal arguments, but many will not. It wasn't an order, rather a firing, but this scared Truman shitless when he wanted to fire MacArthur. Second, there is Congress. Congress can pass law contravening Executive orders, in which case the law takes precedent. Congress can also de-fund offices, projects, etc. that try to do the will of POTUS. So if, for instance, Trump decides we should not do trade deals, but congress signs laws mandating him to do so, we'd be headed in the direction of #3... Third, there is the Supreme Court. If someone sues POTUS for doing something wildly illegal (for instance, violating the fourth amendment by requiring us all to wear ID badges indicating citizenship status), SCOTUS would then decide the issue. Fourth is political expediency. In the past, presidents would have rather used orders sparingly; they really piss off Congress and have the nasty attribute of being tied to the man himself very, very directly. This may be lessened if, for instance, the POTUS has no idea what political capital is and is already willing to simply ignore congress. This, I think, is the most common but hardest to study insomuch that it is the non-event, the deed that gets done without order that matters here. More orders happen under divided government or when the party in power has no one single mind on an issue: executive orders are a desperate tool to try to get something done when the normal legislating process works. I am willing to make the scholarly argument that Obama had to use so many for the sole reason that the modern GOP would have filibustered everything Obama wanted, even if it was a proposal for a bill to have the floors waxed in the Senate to keep the building nice.\",\n",
       "    'The Constitution says that Congress gets to make laws and the executive branch, led by the President, enforces laws. The courts interpret laws, resolve disagreements, and determine punishment within the bounds of laws set by Congress. There is a fourth shadow branch of government that you don\\'t learn about in school: administrative agencies. These are entities-- some famous, like the EPA, NASA, FTC, FCC, and dozens that you\\'ve never heard of-- that are created by Congress and told to do certain things. Usually (and this is grossly oversimplifying) Congress will say, \"we are creating this agency. Here is how agency heads are appointed. This agency needs to regulate X Policy Area (environment, communications, whatever) consistent with Y Vague Standards. They must pass rules and can bring actions against entities that violate rules.\" The rules made by agencies have to be enacted, usually, by procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedures Act, which is like a handbook for agency actions. The APA requires that a proposed rule be published, the public have a chance to comment, and then a final rule must be supported by a statement justifying why the rule is appropriate. Rules passed by agencies have the force and effect of law. Under these grants of authority, agencies actually pass WAY more rules than Congress. Here\\'s where things get interesting: agencies, because they are carrying out laws (enforcing the law created by congress), they are under the executive branch\\'s ultimate control. The President usually has some level of power to appoint and remove agency heads, the President wields political control over agencies, and the President sets the policy agenda. The President, through executive order, can direct an agency to make a rule on a certain topic as long as the rule generally falls within an agency\\'s power. Similarly, the President can direct agencies to NOT enforce a given law! (Think, for example, the choice to not enforce the federal ban on marijuana, or President Obama\\'s DAPA and DACA programs). Presidents since Reagan have seen agencies as extensions of their own policy agendas, and while SOME limits exist, the immense breadth of agencies and delegation of rule-makong authority to the executive branch means that the President has a lot of practical control over federal lawmaking and enforcement through executive action.',\n",

       "  'output': {'156115': ['A lot of the answers in this thread are trying to explain or rationalize *specific* fetishes, but I think OP\\'s question is more general in nature. First, a point of clarification: the word \"fetish\" in common language essentially means \"a sexual attraction or fixation on body parts, objects, or activities not normally associated with sex.\" It\\'s essentially when a person can be particularly sexually aroused by something that isn\\'t typically considered to be arousing. Psychologists have not yet agreed upon a single explanation for why people form fetishes in the first place, but a common explanation involves (accidental) positive feedback loop of classical conditioning on the part of the fetishist. Under the right conditions, somebody who might *weakly* associate a non-sexual stimulus with sex will be able to get arousal out of it, which only further strengthens the association and the arousal that can be gained. Let\\'s say that you\\'re a straight guy with pretty vanilla sexual tastes. You\\'re browsing porn on the internet, when all of a sudden you come across a video featuring a girl wearing a cat ear headband. At this point, you don\\'t have a particular fixation with this sort of thing, but it doesn\\'t turn you off either, and the girl is cute, so you like the video anyway. Meanwhile, your brain is picking up on the cat ears as something \"new,\" and novelty is a *big* factor in your brain\\'s reward system, so when you finish, you\\'ve formed a slight association between \"girl wearing cat ears\" and \"getting your rocks off.\" Fast forward in time a bit to another porn session, and you come across *another* video with a girl wearing cat ears. The reward center in your brain remembers the last one, and is going \"yeah, this was good last time, I like this one too.\" The situation repeats, and strengthens the association between catgirls and sexual pleasure. Repeat this process enough times, and you\\'ll get to the point where you *actively seek* porn with catgirls in it, and maybe you even *require* it to get it up. There won\\'t be a rational reason for you to like this sort of thing, you just *do*, because you\\'ve inadvertently trained yourself to like it. EDIT: Alright, a lot of you are asking the same questions, and I don\\'t have the time to respond to all of you, so I\\'m just going to put this shit up top. * The core thing to keep in mind is that this is all about *arousal*, which is distinct from *pleasure*. Yes, they often go hand-in-hand, but \"arousal\" is basically another word for \"excitement,\" and has meanings that go beyond *sexual* arousal. Anything that excites you, that gets your blood pumping, that gives you a tiny rush of adrenaline and endorphins, can be be considered \"arousing.\" Yes, a lap dance can do that, but so can being threatened with a knife, or being tied down, or being humiliated, or whatever. The associations we make with arousing stimuli depend enormously on the context and timing that we experience them with. If a nonsexual-but-still-arousing stimulus is presented with a sexual stimulus or context, then sexual association can begin to form around that nonsexual cue. * It\\'s *entirely* possible that fetishes might have their origins before somebody reaches puberty. Like I said, \"arousal\" is just \"excitement,\" and is hard-wired into us even more deeply than sex. Understanding of sex and sexual maturity are not requirements for people to be influenced by outside sources. The example I cited with porn is just an *example*, and there\\'s no reason why the same mechanism can\\'t happen earlier in life, and completely by accident. Just because you recognized something as a childhood fetish in retrospect doesn\\'t mean that it didn\\'t form similarly to how I described. I\\'m betting that, whether you realized it was sexual or not, you sought out *more* of that thing because it made you feel good, and fell into the same cycle of reinforcement that I\\'ve described. Mind you, I\\'m not judging here, just explaining. * Homosexuality is *not* considered to be a fetish by the mainstream psychological community, so stop citing it as examples of an \"innate fetish\" or whatnot. It doesn\\'t disprove anything, because you\\'re comparing apples and oranges. However, if you want to talk about *transgenderism*, the field is much less settled on this matter, despite what people on tumblr might say. I\\'d recommend reading [The Man Who Would be Queen]( URL_0 ), which is a book that ignores all of the politically-correct bullshit around identity politics and actually examines it as a scientific phenomenon without trying to judge the fuck out of everybody involved.

Activities and body parts that are usually overlooked or hidden from sight are seen as 'wrong'. These 'wrong' things are a cause of anxiety and shame.

       "    \"When you get turned on, you biologically have to suspend your disgust response for the purposes of getting down and dirty. A lot of sex involves mixing fluids and doing things that your not turned on self might not engage in. The disgust response is a very strong thing in humans, and its very important. It keeps us away from rotten food that could make us ill, or things which could be poisonous, part of the reason so many people are literally disgusted by things like bugs. However, if we were experiencing this strong disgust response we would procreate a lot less, therefore, having the ability to suspend this response is biologically advantageous trait, so from an evolutionary standpoint, makes sense. Now what does all this have to do with fetishes, well, things like licking feet, armpits, sniffing underwear and many others, all have an element of taboo to them, such that people who dont have these fetishes are disgusted by them. Our complex brains remember stimuli that feels good and rewarding, and its very easy to form an association that when you are engaging in 'dirty' behaviour, your getting ready to engage in sex, which we all want to do more of. So you directly associate your dirty secret with a state of arousal, you've 'made yourself ready' for sex by taking part in the fetish, because you've successfully suspended your disgust response to the activity. These associations are unique to everyone, depending on what you engage in, try, and start to think that your fetish =sexy time. That's why some people can have one specific fetish, but not the other, even if that other person is into an equally 'disgusting' fetish. one likes feet, the other armpits etc. This still holds true for other fetishes you might not think immediately have a 'dirty' component to them, like being dominated, but a big part of that is turning over control, willing to accept anything that other person wants to do with you, you have to be in this 'ready for sex' altered state to be titlized by the idea that they can treat you as degrading as they like and there is nothing you can do about it.\",\n",

In my own childhood, when I was 3-5 years old, I loved the movie \"The Jungle Book\". Like, I watched it almost daily. In one of the opening scenes (so when my attention span was still fresh), there\\'s a snake that has an oddly seductive voice who tries to eat the main character. He seduces him and tries to get him to go to sleep. Look up \"Kaa\" on Youtube to see what I mean. As a kid, I loved that scene, and it always made me feel funny. I believe some instinct in me had an idea what sex was, and hearing this snake speak like this confused me. I ended up thinking this was sex. Flash forwards a few years, I\\'m in middle school. We are reading \"The Jungle Book\", and someone in the class mentions the snake. I suddenly am flooded with memories, and feel compelled to look up the snake online, and find tons of fanart, and many, many similar pictures, with different creatures eating women. Turns out, I\\'m into vorarephillia, sexual arousal by people being eaten. My girlfriend has a similar story. As a kid, she played a pet-raising simulator, and used to love feeding the pets too much. She liked the way they rubbed their bellies, and she said their groans always made her laugh. She then developed a love of seeing similar things in cartoons, when people would eat too much and groan. She said she always loved the noises, and believes her mind interpreted those groans as sexual moans. Like me, she outgrows this as she gets older, until middle school, when one of her friends on DeviantArt starts uploading pictures with the feeding/stuffing fetish. Suddenly, she finds herself sexually attracted to the idea of people eating and gaining weight (luckily for me, she doesn\\'t want herself to gain weight and she can keep her perfect body :P ).

Perhaps humans are even unique in the way that we treat it - as something to hide away and share with only a selective audience. Accordingly we have all sorts of cultural motivators towards sex in private, monogamy (albeit some animals are monogamous), we cover up our sex organs with clothing, and so on. This behaviour probably has some good Darwinian basis around mate selection, limiting sexual violence within the species (males killing each other in competition etc) and so on, and these in turn lead to fetishes. Where we have shame and an expected set of behaviours, so we also have transgression and deviance from those behaviours. tl:dr I suspect fetishes are a sort of psychological byproduct of shame rather than a primary evolutionary behaviour in their own right.',\n",

The reason fetishes are taboo is purely due to society saying it is so. Our society has accepted fetishes of many things (men over 6ft, woman with large chests, blondes, redheads, ethnicities, muscle, fat) and other cultures have fetishes we may see as taboo (elongated necks, perceived effeminate males, bestiality). Its important to note, mate selection based off our fetishes is not done so entirely for reproductive reasons. Producing offspring with a person based off a physical trait may - or may not - help with natural survival but could provide a social advantage, as people are predisposed to make opinions based off of physical features. Being able to thrive in society is important to humans survival as we are a group animal.

To anyone wanting a little more detailed information, here\\'s what one of the leading Clinical Sexologists says about Sexual Template, which helps to further explain fetishes. Link too:( URL_0 ) At the root of human sexual desire is the “core erotic personality”–a.k.a. “sexual template”–which, in a nutshell, is whatever gets you off. “Everyone has in their mind an image of someone or thing they find sexually desirous,” explains Dr. William Granzig William Granzig , dean of clinical sexology at Maimonides University in North Miami Beach and president of the American Board of Sexology. That image might be a person of specific age, race or hair color, or it might be every person. It could be a fondness for a particular style of dress, objects such as women’s shoes or fur-lined handcuffs, or behavior such as cross-dressing or exhibitionism. Whatever it is in particular, the sexual template is believed to develop early on during a childhood erotic experience–perhaps as early as age three or four–and it sticks with you for life. The difficulty of maintaining sexual desire over the long term, of course, is that if your partner falls outside of your sexual template–or you fall outside theirs–sooner or later one of you is going to lose interest. “Many people whose template is not, say, age-specific can have great sex throughout their lives,” notes Granzig. “But if you’re only attracted to 20-year-olds, once your partner hits 30, your desire will decrease. Unless, of course, you can figure out some ways to spice things up.\"',\n",

       "    'There are several different cognitive mechanisms so it might make sense to actually use different words rather than calling them all \"fetishes\". But simply, the most basic is based on brain wiring -you\\'re born with them- the most common being neural crosstalk between areas mapping genitalia and those of the feet. The second is positive reinforcement, which associates particular objects or concepts with a positive sexual reward. These can develop over time. And then there is the most difficult to understand mechanism, known as aversion suppression. Because it is in your biological interest to have sex, the brain will counter aversive stimuli by pumping up your sex drive; if there is something a little bit icky going on, you will end up being _more_ sexually engaged because your brain is compensating for the ickiness. These fetishes are also built up over time. A simple example is french kissing (ordinarily aversive thing -mouth to mouth is gross in other circumstances- increases sexual engagement because of the aversion-suppression response), but via the same mechanism people can develop positive responses to different aversive stimuli, explaining, for example, shit fetishes (not to put too fine a point on it). Generally speaking, if there is something that should not be sexually stimulating, it is for that exact reason likely to be someone\\'s fetish, due to the aversion suppression response. There is also an empathic aversion suppression -if we see someone engaged in sex while also doing something gross, we subconsciously/intuitively infer that they must be _really_ turned on.',\n",

       "    'I wrote a scientific paper in college regarding broad sexual attraction and preferences and why they tend to differ among cultures and generations within a culture. I specifically examined specific body type preferences by generation in the United States, with a few asides to other cultures. If you look at the female body type most preferred by men by decade, you see a huge range of sizes and shapes. They range from the curvy days of Madonna, to the athletic beach bodies of the 80\\'s, and lets not forget the thin and frail androgynous waif of the 90\\'s. Generally, sexual attraction has influences which are biological, societal, and derived from personal experience. They reflect what we find biologically appealing, socially appealing (physical indicators of upper class are ++) and personally appealing. Someone\\'s body shape preference, for example, can be driven by biology. People tend to prefer characteristics that are directly or indirectly associated with health and fertility. There can also be societal influences- what has society concluded is important? What celebrities are popular at the time and what are their physical characteristics? What body types are selected for advertisements, movies, and media that\\'s shown to young people? Often times societal preferences act as a pendulum. After so many years of one \"ideal\", people push against it. Different body types have novelty and people get tired of looking at the same shapes. And of course, there are preferences and fetishes derived from personal experiences. General attraction is more influenced by biology and society, but specific fetishes draw a lot on personal experiences and the arbitrary details that we associated with sexual attraction. We collect a lot of these during our developing years and early sexual experiences. Perhaps the first time you had a crush on an adult woman was an elementary school teacher who wore glasses, and later in life you find glasses to be sexy and mysterious. A lot of people have preferences that are associated with power and control, whether it\\'s relinquishing it or taking it. These can be hugely influenced by a person\\'s personality as an adult or by their experiences growing up. So basically, a lot can contribute so someone\\'s fetishes or sexual attractions. Looking at an individual you could probably get to the bottom of their personal fetishes. It\\'s harder to draw conclusions about society as a whole.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, I don't think I see the answer. Let me give that a shot: * **Foot Fetish**: Imagine being a cave man living before there is language or even fire. You want to find a mate. What do you look at? Well, feet are a very good candidate because nobody is wearing shoes. Humans feet are the only part that constantly touch the ground. They get scared from the terrain and as the scars are exposed to the soil, they grow infections. SO, you look at a potential mate's feet. If it's clean, it shows they have a good immune system or they don't need to walk far away for food. Eventually, humans start to find feet a key factor in sexual stuff. * **Dominance**: This has to do with social hierarchy. In every tribe there have been the alphas and betas. Enjoying receiving orders from someone is great to keep the tribe going. * **HotWife/Rape Fetish**: It's not only humans. Birds have this as an example. It helps the animal receive genes that will not normally end up in their genetic tree so that they will use the diversity and better immune system. Basically, you should keep in mind that for the most part humans have not been civilized so they developed all these fetishes to survive. Some fetishes happened to be actually quite useful in helping you and your children survive so they remained even though they are strange.\",\n",

Fun fact I blame much of the foot fetish on shoes - if feet were all over and everywhere, they probably wouldn't be the driving kink they are for some people. Many sexual fetishes have roots in childhood. Sexuality isn't a precise or pure thing, it's a set of physiological motivations the body provides to vaguely hope to motivate the human toward reproduction. It can rope in any number of things and be like 'oh yeah, we like this' and boom. People like the taste of things that are plenty unhealthy. To shut down the avenues your body provides you for experiencing and appreciating things sexually is alot like ignoring any personal preferences for what food you may like or love to eat in favor of always consuming solely optimal nutrition at all times, hypothetically; it can kind of be neglecting your own human experience.\",\n",

The idea was that some guys chose specific things that women had that men generally didn't, the example in the book was high heels or long hair. These boys would initially get attracted those things and normally the boy would develop and start being attracted to the female themselves rather than their hair or high heels BUT in some cases boys don't develop any further than that, and remain attracted to only the hair or heels. Then the fetish is born TLDR: HAIR AND HIGH HEELS\",\n",

A single one or zero is a bit, and 8 of these put together (at least in most modern computers) is a byte. But brains don\\'t work like that at all. We store memories as connections between nerve cells, so bytes is not a very applicable unit to measure brain capacity with. A more accurate measure of brain capacity is the number of connections in the brain.',\n",
       "    'Most computer scientists would say yes. The brain occupies a finite amount of space and since the universe is discrete, there is a finite amount of information in there. Personally, I\\'m not too comfortable with the number of assumptions being made with that logic, but my position on that matter is controversial. I do know that to say the brain\\'s storage reduces to the number of neuron connections is probably not correct. It\\'s far more complex than that. There is also a dynamic electro-chemical state between and within the synapses which has some information storage capacity--various ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, for instance. Things like \"are you happy\" probably aren\\'t stored in a chart showing which neuron is connected to which other. You can take a pill to change that variable. Then, unlike a regular computer, the brain and the body has evolved an extremely integrated interface with its environment such that it\\'s often difficult to tell where you draw the line between brain and not-brain. For instance, what about your body temperature? It effects cognition, and is in a feedback path with the brain. Could that be considered a form of storage? There are many examples like that. It\\'s often forgotten that information is specific to context. A forgotten language can only be deciphered if we actually share something with the lost civilization-- feelings, biology, environment. The brain is weird because it creates its own context. Since the brain is so closely integrated with its environment, its identity can become blurred and it can become unclear *where* the brain actually is. Your brain organized your room and now your room effects your cognition. Is your room information storage? You have a romantic partner. Your brain interacts with them and changes them. Now they interact with you and change your cognition. Are they storage? The [transactive memory hypothesis] ( URL_0 ) builds on this idea and suggests there are memories that we can only have or have better when we\\'re together with someone we\\'ve interacted with before. You could say that these external sources are just external and thus we can ignore them. But your environment, which your brain is changing, effects you whether or not you ask for it. In that way, the external is really not so external. Your environment is not like a USB flash drive. You can\\'t unplug it. There are numerous examples of what happens when you try to unplug it. Extreme isolation for example. The brain just breaks down in these contexts. So environment is actually part of you. If the brain doesn\\'t have well-defined limits, then measuring its capacity is going to be incredibly difficult. It could still be a number in bytes depending on which physics you subscribe to. It\\'s commonly believed that the whole universe has a finite storage capacity. If so, then even a brain without a skull limit still has a universe limit.',\n",

You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there\\'s all that naughty stuff you\\'re not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what \"they want to be when they grow up\". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don\\'t really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You\\'ve got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you\\'ve got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You\\'ve also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you\\'ve got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don\\'t pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you\\'re not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you\\'ve never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you\\'re going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it\\'s going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can\\'t afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there\\'s all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won\\'t, but... there\\'s a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you\\'re not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you\\'ve ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won\\'t ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don\\'t have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it\\'s not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn\\'t make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don\\'t have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It\\'s a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren\\'t so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve.

If you operate a business, you've got employees at all levels and you pay those employees enough to keep them happy enough that they don't leave. That means what you pay them is strongly related to their expectations. People expect to be paid around the industry standard for their profession. They expect to be paid in accordance to their years of service/experience. They expect to be paid based on their level in the company. They also expect to be paid more than they were in the past. If you violate these expectations, you'll end up with workers leaving - even if their pay is competitive in the market. So let's say you've got a line of widget wranglers. You pay all of them $10/hour. Unemployment drops and you simply can't find new widget wranglers to replace the ones who retire or drop out of the workforce at $10/hour. So you offer $12/hour to new hires. How do you think that makes your existing employees feel once they find out? Probably pretty angry. So before you can offer $12/hour to new widget wranglers, you've got to give all your *old* widget wranglers $12/hour. Which means giving a raise to all their supervisor so they're not being paid less than their subordinates - which means giving a raise to all *their* supervisors, etc. Now you've give a company-wide raise to everyone just so you can hire a few widget-wranglers. Suddenly a recession occurs. Now you've got a massive payroll you can't afford. But you can't simply cut wages - your employees would feel insulted and leave. So you're losing money hand over foot simply because you needed a very junior level of employee. The alternative? You could have simply not hired that extra widget wrangler at $12/hour and waited it out until you found someone willing to accept $10/hour. The latter strategy is almost always the more sensible one.\",\n",

Similarly, when companies hire new positions, they'll raise the wage they offer when they see they aren't getting candidates or ones that are qualified.

Statements such as \" we have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts\" and that the U.S. did not intend to \"start an economic war against Iraq\". This was said while Iraqi forces were forming on the border with Kuwait. These statements and others, said and not said, was seen as a go ahead for invasion. The U.S. didn\\'t think Iraq was really going to annex Kuwait. The U.S. believed it was just posturing by the Iraqis to put pressure on Kuwait for debt relief and lower oil prduction. I\\'ve heard that Saddam was surprised by the response from the U.S.',\n",

       "    \"Because, well, history wasn't on the side of that. Iraq was the strongest military power in the region. While the Cold War was winding down, the US and USSR still didn't see eye to eye, and both had, within the past generation, had foreign military adventures (Vietnam and Afghanistan) that were PR disasters at home. Saddam figured that as long as the oil kept flowing, the west wouldn't give a shit who was selling it, or about the politics of the region. That math might have been true a decade earlier, but clearly not in 1990.\",\n",
       "    'Kuwait was slant mining and tapping into Iraqi oil reserves. At the time Iraq had the stronger military in the region and had relatively good relations with the US. Through diplomatic channels, the US said they considered the dispute to be a regional matter, hinting they would not oppose a military solution. Iraq either misunderstood, or more likely, figured they could invade quickly enough and be so entrenched that the US and other countries would not have the will to intervene. They failed to take into account the how the fail of the Soviet Union broke the Cold War stalemate and made it a lot easier for western power to act.',\n",
       "    'While a lot of posts are mentioning the western viewpoint of why people think Iraq did it there are very few actually telling the real viewpoint why Saddam did it. - Kuwait was actually drilling into wells that were accessed by Iraq siphoning oil off their reserves (some people mentioned this, but it was basically the last straw so to speak) - Kuwait had absolutely TONS of oil reserves keeping the prices low which really really hurt Iraq at the time which had a lot of debt from the Iraq / Iran war. - Kuwait and Baghdad had a partnership that went back hundreds of years. Iraqi\\'s were the major reason why Kuwait became a commercial boom center (long before oil) As you can see from the [border]( URL_0 ) It\\'s got a huge port and a lot more coastline in the Gulf. All very valuable and since it was Iraqis who made that port into the boom country it is (before oil) and now it\\'s mega rich with oil, it makes a lot of sense. So to sum up the why. - Kuwait was siphoning off oil - Had gigantic reserves keeping the price low - Iraq had a lot of debt from a previous war - Historically Iraqi\\'s helped make Kuwait what it is today All of that is the reason why. Saddam had the means, the need, and both present and past reasons to do it. Now on to why Saddam thought nobody would care in the Western world. - First off the US/West really hadn\\'t been involved in the regions conflicts all that much. They would sell arms, send support that way, but not actually get involved militarily. Russia did in Afghanistan, but that was them, and the west really wasn\\'t into doing that sort of thing. - He was actually correct about that. The west really didn\\'t care at all about the region enough to get involved at all in a hands on sort of way. In fact Britain got out of a lot of places in the last 50 years. But the economic interest isn\\'t what he expected at all. - Kuwait has billions upon billions of pounds in British banks. The reason is because of the alliance Mubarak made with the crown a long time ago when Britain was looking for influence in the region to help with trade routes to/from India. Basically later Britain agreed to defend Kuwait and ensure its National Security, and Kuwait agreed to give it a secure oil supply. - This was Saddam\\'s miss calculation. Britain\\'s tie to Kuwait was VERY big. Billions in British pounds at very very cheap oil prices. If Britain didn\\'t honor the agreement to protect Kuwait, Kuwait would pull its money out of the British banks. Now if you think the housing collapse in the US is bad, Kuwait pulling out of its British investments would have been absolutely a killer to the British economy. (Kuwait invested like 5 billion in Spain in the late 80s that basically was a bust, but they have that kind of money where they are annoyed but no big deal. ) So when Britain saw Iraq invade Kuwait they had to do something, not because the care about the Kuwait people. They did it because their economy depended on it, and if their economy depends on it...The US economy depended on it. So What Saddam missed was the major economic threat that Kuwait was going to serve Britain if they didn\\'t get their ass over there and kick out Saddam. This also set up the whole Iraq war 2 Electric Bugaloo with Tony Blair. \"George W. Bush: Hey remember when my dad saved your ass with the whole Saddam thing? Well it\\'s time to pay us back, don\\'t worry we\\'ll cut you in for a piece of that oil action\", and that\\'s why Blair and Bush were joined at the hip for Iraq part 2. So what did Saddam not understand? That Britain was economically heavily tied to Kuwait so much so that they had to intervene no matter what or risk going into a massive recession, which would send the US into one.',\n",
       "    \"Iraq and Iran has just finished an eight year war. During that war, there was a subset of conflict called the 'Tanker War' in which a lot of Oil Transports transferred their flag to American subsidiaries. Iran was a dangerous entity in the '80's. A very new government, espousing a form of Islam that the rest of the Gulf (Saudi, Kuwait, U.A.E etc) were afraid of. Iraq 'stepped up to the plate' and went to war against Iran, a move that the other Gulf states felt great relief over, because the war curbed Iran's Islamic expansion. Nominally, every country in the Gulf supported Iraq during this war. 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.' Iraq had the equipment (Tanks, Planes, Artillery) and Iran had the bodies (Human Wave attacks). After eight years, Iraq was financially wasted and Iran had a very bloody nose. Iraq needed money and that money came in the form of Oil Revenue. Kuwait, who 'had Iraq's back' during the war, owned large oil producing fields. When Iraq went to Kuwait saying 'Look, we fought the Iranians and stopped them from invading the other gulf states now we need money', Kuwait apparently no longer had their back. Iraq needed the oil but Kuwait had it. There were claims to diagonal drilling and '19th Provence'. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to diffuse the situation but failed miserably, giving Saddam Hussain the impression that he had a green light from the United States to Invade. Saddam had a delusion that he was a major player in the world. He felt his military was strong enough to deter any intervention. He miscalculated. This has a lot to do with the command structure of the government and the military in Iraq. Saddam felt he couldn't lose because he had led such a magical life and there was no one in his circle of advisers that would contradict him. To do so meant death or ostracizing. He was surrounded by 'yes men'. Saddam had built up a cult of personality. The first Gulf war cracked that wall.\",\n",

They thought their power and distance from from the United States and other major players would keep international players from interfering. Saddam, as he would many times in his life, miscalculated. All regional powers are given a certain amount of leeway in controlling their backyard, but Saddam overestimated Iraqi power and underestimated the economic importance of Kuwait as well as a recent strengthening of US-Kuwait relations. Especially, Saddam overestimated the leverage he had over the United States in a post-Cold War environment, when he was used to having the US relatively eager to keep a major regional power happy. Of course, the people who miscalculated the worst were the Kuwaitis, who thought their increased drilling from the field shared between Iraq and Kuwait would force Iraq to the negotiating table, but instead led to tanks rolling over the borders. Honestly, the US probably would have been okay with Iraq strongarming Kuwait, maybe shooting up some oil wells and some salvos of artillery while promising more to come if Kuwait didn't settle down. But a full-fledged invasion and occupation was too far over the line given the strengthening ties between the US and Kuwait - the same way Russia would be playing a very dangerous game if it tried to annex all of Ukraine instead of just Crimea. Consider how even in their blatant annexation of Crimea, Russia plays politics by insisting it's local sentiment and Ukrainian secessionists and no Russia has no idea where those tanks came from. We let Germany have Austria because we could imagine a sufficient excuse, and we let Germany have Czechoslovakia because Hitler asked nicely and the German war machine was pretty terrifying. And of course, many of the relevant politicians could remember WW2 and so could their political bases, so any appeasement would have made them look weaker than they would have in the absence of Hitler. Saddam forgot to even ask - in the modern world, you have to give the world powers a chance to save face if you're going to exert military force. TL;DR Saddam thought Iraq had a hard sphere of influence that would let him apply an Iraqi version of the Monroe Doctrine/Iron Curtain, but it didn't.\",\n",

As for Saddam not anticipating the strong U.S. response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. diplomat April Glaspie told Saddam Hussein shortly before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that the U.S. takes no sides in Arab-on-Arab disputes (or something along those lines). Indeed, Saddam Hussein appears to have misinterpreted April Glaspie's statement and thought that this statement meant that the U.S. will not militarily intervene in the event that Iraq invaded Kuwait. Also, while the U.S. did, in fact, militarily intervene against Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait, it is worth noting that the vote in favor of war in the U.S. Senate was a narrow 52 to 47, with the overwhelming majority of Democrats voting against war. Thus, Saddam Hussein's view that the U.S. will not go to war with Iraq in response to an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait might have very well been accurate if a Democrat, rather than a Republican, would have been the U.S. President at the time that Saddam Hussein would have invaded Kuwait. Indeed, in hindsight, all that Saddam Hussein might have needed to do to more-or-less get away with an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait would have been to wait a couple of years or more before he would have actually invaded Kuwait.

In poor urban areas, it is much cheaper and easier to hit up the McDonald\\'s dollar menu, get a big tray of chicken and rice from a food stand, or go to the grocery store whose shelves are loaded with enriched, unhealthy, processed crap. There aren\\'t very many Whole Foods\\' or farmer\\'s markets in these neighborhoods and poor people who are working multiple part-time jobs dont\\' generally take the time to travel to more affluent neighborhoods to buy food.

Poor people want to get the most for their dollar, so they buy bigger, get the super-sized fries, etc...

Fatty foods and carbs store well and are cheap, and the carbs especially pack on weight. And why do poor people buy junk food? Because being so poor, they can't afford outtings and events, a bag of chips is sometimes the only little comfort they can afford. --- As far as Prof. Haub, I would argue that diet took a lot of effort to execute - to formulate and to stay on target. And eating is not just about calories. I can exceed my calorie needs with just a couple candy bars, but that doesn't A) meet my nutritional needs and B) doesn't satiate my hunger. Most people are going to eat until they are at least satisfied, and poor people are eating cheap food to do it. Carbs. They'll blow way past their caloric needs on cheap food until they feel satiated. And not all carbs are created equal. Don't undervalue biochemistry.

A food high in polysaccharides are going to go straight to your thighs while your body consumes smaller and easier carbohydrates.  >  Shouldn't poverty actually be incentive to lose weight then, since a person will save money by reducing the amount of food they eat?

They retired as free people, and it was really more like having your country invaded then being given a job you have to do. Others like the Romans would keep foreigners as slaves, and you could be born a slave. These slaves were invisible though to society - they belonged to a household and had to do the jobs they were given, but they had time off, sometimes got paid, they fell in love and got married and had families. You couldn't tell if someone walking up the street was a slave or not. These slaves are the ancestors of the European peasant, the common folks. It was only in about the 17th century or so that we got the idea that people should be allowed to say 'no' if their Lord told them to do something. The American South did not view Africans as human beings, but as animals. They broke up families, they engaged in forced breeding programs where men were beaten until they raped the woman they were told to breed with, they recklessly endangered slaves lives, they did not allow any sort of dignity. 'Chattel' slavery is the most powerfully dehumanizing form of slavery, and it only ever existed in the Caribbean and American South.\",\n",

It is also a country that, more so than almost any other, thinks of itself as a \"free\" country open to all, something that is directly opposed to the idea of slavery.

From what I recently learned studying the American Revolution, like the French one, it was centered around ideas of liberty and self-determination. The American Revolution did not deliver on those promises for all, just like the French Revolution did not free slaves also. However, by the time the AR happened there was pressures within revolutionaries and from French intellectuals (including Lafayette) about the disconnect between AR ideas and the continuation of slavery. IIRC by this time, France had abolished slavery. Haiti had also had a revolution and freed itself from slavery. What this meant was that while the FR and its ideas continued to have resonance around the world, the AR was seen as hypocritical and one that did not deliver on its promises. Even Jefferson, who was Lafeyette's buddy, contemplated freeing slaves but did not ultimately deliver. Slavery has been on the American conscience for a long time. Combined with the U.S.'s rise as a superpower and self-proclaimed moral authority, slavery and civil rights continued to be an issue that actually undercut the way Americans imagined their country, revolution, and projected the image of their country. Some historians like Barrington Moore, thus, in part do not even consider the AR as a revolution, opting instead to count the Civil War as one, because they believe there was not enough revolutionary change during the AR.

       "    'Selling to who? Other Africans or Westerners? Could you clarify? If you mean selling to Europeans and Americans - you need to remember that you are applying a modern and Western definition of blackness that does not apply to Africa at this time. African nations do not really consider themselves \"Black\" in the American sense. They consider themselves African and whatever nation they come from. This also applied to pre-Atlantic Slave Trade Africa - they were not \"black\", but instead identified based on whatever kingdom or city-state they lived in. Taking this into consideration, Africans were not \"selling their own\" because they did not consider these people their own. They were often selling prisoners of war from rival states. They did not relate with these people. It would be like Italians selling French people into slavery - just because they are both European doesn\\'t mean they consider each other their own. There were also economic and political pressures for African kingdoms to do this. And after the Atlantic Slave Trade boomed - Westerners began to kidnap many Africans instead of buying them directly. The demand for slaves was just so high that Westerners resorted to this and could get away with it. You also need to recognize that these African states did not realize what the Atlantic Slave Trade would entail. They didn\\'t know that people would be chained and packed into slave ships where they would be laying in their own vomit and filth. They did not realize that many of these people would die before even reaching America and that the rest of them would be brutally beaten and dehumanized. American slavery is talked about even today because it was a vile and gruesome form of slavery that was unprecedented at the time. So while, yes, Africans did sell other Africans into Western slavery initially, that does not mean that you can hold them accountable for the atrocities that American slaves lived through.',\n",

They did not have a place to relieve themselves so more often that not they were lying in their own filth for the duration of the journey. More than half of the slaves died on the month long journeys to the new world and more than a few lost their minds by the time they arrived.

Meanwhile the egg white are basically water and protein, which as /u/mb34i said can do some pretty impressive tricks.

Here at ELI5 you are likely to get the same kind of easily-memorable but wrong answer that your dad gave you when you were 5. **answer**: The air gets colder as you go up because the lower atmosphere is mixed up by up-and-down winds, which I\\'ll explain in a moment. Air that moves up expands and cools off as it goes up, because all gases cool off as they expand. Air that moves down gets compressed and heats up from the compression. You can notice that kind of cooling if you spray a whole bunch of paint out of one of your dad\\'s cans of spray paint -- the can will get cold from the expansion. You can notice that kind of heating if you pump up a bike tire. The nozzle of the air pump will get hot from the compression. Up and down motions of the air carry a tremendous amount of heat up and down in the part of the atmosphere where we live, and mix it all up. That makes the air at every height above sea level the same temperature as it would be if it just came up from sea level very fast, so up high the air is colder because it just expanded more. That lowest part of the atmosphere is called the \"troposphere\" (pronounced like \"trope oh sphere\"). The reason the troposphere mixes up heat is that air in these bottom, dense layers of the atmosphere is heated by the sunlit ground. Air right near the ground gets warm, then expands and rises (like a hot air balloon, without the balloon). As it rises, it cools off -- but it\\'s still warmer than the cooler air around it, so it carries on rising for a long time -- up to about 20,000 or 30,000 feet above the ground(!) Eventually, that little parcel of air does cool off by radiating heat (like a warm rock cools off if you put it in the shade), and then it sinks all the way back down to the ground again to get some more heat. All of the air in the troposphere does that more or less all the time.

For homes it is very different from ants to ants. But some ants for example go around potential homes and leave pheromone trails along the walls.

       "  'output': {'5463710': [\"I'll try and make this as simple as possible. Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach are not all classical composers. Before Bach a lot of music was very simple, a single vocal or chorus and maybe an instrument playing too. Bach was ~~an early~~ a later composer in the Baroque era, this era of music introduced much more complexity with multiple instrument parts, but it was still relatively simple music, usually featuring a single lead instrument with backing. Bach is seen as one of the best composers of this era, or at least the quintessential Baroque composer. Mozart was ~~one of the first~~ a classical composers. The classical movement put a lot more emphasis on technical excellence in its music. Instead of the Baroque style of having a single lead instrument and backing pieces classical music would have different parts for every instrument in the orchestra, each instruments sound would weave the fabric of the music. Beethoven wrote music in both Classical and the new Romantic style. The Romantic style took Classical and made it more dramatic. Rather than being about just technical excellence it was about the feel of the music, the ebb and flow. The composer was trying to evoke emotions in the listeners with their music. The music would alter its tempo and timbre, it would quiet down to a single instrument only to explode back into the full orchestra. Each of these musicians is considered the best of their era, each era was considered a leap forward in the philosophy of music. EDIT: A few improvements. EDIT 2: Clarification to answer OP's question. Each of these composers is seen as the height, or quintessential, composer of their respective eras.\",\n",
       "    \"As a professor of music I get this question at least once a term. Either they were the first to do something (Beethoven) or they did something so well they became the point of departure (Bach). I'll try to keep theory out of this. Beethoven is seen as the pivotal figure for the change from classical to romantic music. His career follows this line as his early imitated the late classical style but soon morphed into what would be the example of the new romantic music. By the time Bach started writing, his primary style was falling out of fashion. However Bach wrote so well and so much that he became the defining figure for his style- but not until later. In his lifetime Bach was seen as a good musician but more known for his performance and leadership activities. It wasn't until hundred years after his death did people really start to recognize the quality of his music. Mozart is kind of a strange exception. He was not considered the best of his day. He was kind of late to the classical party being preceded by Bach's own children (CPE and JC) and Haydn as well. He also did not live long enough to really push the envelope. His music is of high quality, no doubt, but it was far from the most popular of its time. Yet his music endures due to its accessibility (ease of listening) and partially because of who he was in life. As far as being better than each other that is very subjective. Just because a composer is old or time-honored doesn't make him better than another. Who knows, in a hundred years Williams could be on that list. before 1850ish Bach wouldn't even be on your list. The most important thing about music is learning to understand in its own terms. TL;DR: Its a combination of skill, timing, and pure lucky circumstance that these composers stand out. Now do you own appreciation homework.\",\n",
       "    'Although I agree with some of the other good answers here, you also need to make a distinction between compositional technique, and the music that results from it. Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven all share the qualities of being some of the most innovative and technically virtuosic in terms of technique. However, one could also argue that Webern was incredibly virtuosic in compositional technique, but hardly anyone listens to his music any more. So clearly the actual music is important in how it withstands the test of time. But to explain (hopefully in a simple way) how compositional technique plays into all of this, I will try to provide a few examples. Bach was considered a master of *counterpoint* - which is a term to describe music made up of multiple interlocking melody lines. A very simple example is singing in a round - imagine Row, Row, Row Your Boat sung by three groups starting at different times. You end up with distinct melody lines that interlock and sound cool together. What Bach did was basically take that concept (not necessarily the same melody, but ones that fit well together) and run with it. He was known to write up to five or six separate voices that all lined up and sounded cool pretty much all the time. By contrast, most other composers of his time rarely made it past four voices, and even then some screwed up and it didn\\'t sound as pretty. Mozart was known for being incredibly prolific as well as being a musical genius. Mozart may well be so famous simply because he wrote SO MUCH music - he wrote 41 symphonies in his (relatively short) lifetime, compared to Beethoven who wrote only 9, yet lived much longer. Mozart wrote in almost every genre (except for an inexplicable hatred of the cello) and almost every instrument has Mozart works that feature them. Mozart was also a child prodigy and developed a substantial performance career by the time he was 7 or 8 years old. Because of his incredibly performance skill (similar to later composers like Liszt) he was able to write music that really pushed the performer\\'s skill at the instrument, especially in piano and violin. Since that was also a time where the piano as an instrument was evolving rapidly, it became increasingly important to develop repertoire that pushed the technical constraints of the instrument, which Mozart did very successfully. Beethoven, in contrast to Mozart, was known for his skills in *motivic development* - that is, taking one short musical idea (a motive) and finding creative ways to continue using that idea throughout a whole piece. Consider one of his most famous works, Symphony No. 5. Everyone has heard those opening four notes - \"duhduhduh DUN\" - and the majority of the first movement essentially used and reused those four notes for upwards of 6-7 minutes of music, an awfully long time to not get bored of four notes. Beethoven is considered skillful expressly because he used relatively little new material, but still somehow made his pieces interesting and tell a story and make sense on an emotional level. This is what many composers strive for today, and could arguably be seen as the impetus for modern musical movements like minimalism. Besides that, of course, all three composers were not only well known simply for their own music, but because they managed to withstand the test of time by having people continue to advocate for their music after their deaths. Actually, Bach was not all that famous once he died - it wasn\\'t until Felix Mendelssohn \"rediscovered\" and popularized his music that people acknowledged Bach as more than some random old dude who wrote a few hits back in his day. Although Mozart and Beethoven didn\\'t have as dramatic a change in fame, their music remains popular because people have kept their music alive through performance and study. And while this might be slightly outside of the scope of your original question, there is also a more practical aspect. Many performers of classical music are subject to as much marketing as anything else in order to make a living. In other words, orchestras (for example) have to market their product to the public in order to keep ticket sales up and advertising revenue going. Since certain composers have an extremely high amount of name recognition, many orchestras will choose to perform pieces by those composers, hoping that they will draw in a wider audience than performing more obscure music that only caters to a small niche community. Then, because these orchestras primarily perform \"popular\" classical music, those are the pieces that most people hear about or actually attend concerts or buy recordings. They know they like those pieces, and continue to go to see the \"greatest hits\". Other than a small population of \"classical connoisseurs\", most people are unlikely to risk seeing a concert of really obscure pieces they\\'ve never heard before - there\\'s too much variation in classical music to guarantee that you\\'ll like a piece by an unknown composer, and for people who are not trained in music, it may not be very interesting because the differences in classical music are often more difficult to hear without knowing what to look for (which is another ELI5 topic to itself, I think). So, in short, because it\\'s easier and more profitable to continue playing Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, it tends to be the music that sticks around especially if you are not deep in your local classical music scene. Other composers are just as \"good\" in the sense that you can definitely enjoy listening to their music just as much. But they haven\\'t broken into the ubiquitous fame that those three have. **as a caveat to anyone who might criticize, I\\'m using the term \"classical\" in the standard vernacular sense meaning music from the Western art music tradition during the Common Practice Period (ca. 17th-19th centuries) or music that seeks to actively follow or emulate those musical styles. As for source, I\\'m just your average music major who dreams of studying musicology, which helps explains many of these questions.',\n",
       "    'Part of being the \"best\" is being the first to do something. For example, many people say that The Beatles are the best rock band of all time. Part of the reason why they believe this is that The Beatles were one of the first bands to really turn pop music on its head. Everything that came after was influenced by The Beatles. Similarly, Beethoven, Mozart and Bach were all on the cutting edge of their respective genres. Bach mastered baroque music to a point where everything that came after was viewed as a copy of him. Same with Beethoven  &  the \"romantic\" style, and Mozart with the classical style. Are they better than a composer like John Williams? Well, that is a matter of opinion. Many people believe that John Williams\\' work is derivative - meaning it is simply copying the styles and sometimes even tunes of other composers. Personally, I think John Williams is a fantastic composer who has an uncanny ability to match the feeling of a movie character with music, and I will happily listen to his stuff alongside Beethoven. Is there a \"best\" out of the three? I don\\'t think so. Some people say Mozart is the best, but I personally can\\'t stand to listen to anything he wrote. Beethoven and Bach are two of my favourite composers but I wouldn\\'t try to compare the two of them as their styles are so completely different.',\n",

Bach\\'s music is very tricky sometimes and can be difficult to sing along to. It always feels like it is running forward and can be fun to clean the house to. Bach likes to use a LOT of notes. We call these trills. Mozart made lots and lots of music that is very easy to remember and very easy to sing. Did you know he was writing music when he was 6 and was quite famous across Europe? Most of Mozart\\'s music sounds very happy and is played a lot. Mozart is tricky though. It may sound very easy, but it is very hard to play. He tried many new things that other composers had not thought of and everyone thought he was quite grand. I\\'m told he had a funny laugh as well. Beethoven was a very serious man and he wrote very serious music. Beethoven liked to try to make you angry, happy, sad, anxious and relieved, all in one piece of music. He liked to see how many different emotions he could make you feel. He was kind of a Drama queen when it came to music and he tried more new things than Mozart did. This made him quite famous. There is no \"best\\' composer. Bach is good if you want background music or would like to clean up something. Mozart is good to listen with friends and sing along with. Beethoven is good to feel very dramatic, like when you need to make a speech. (writing for a 5 year old is...tough)',\n",
       "    'Wow, that\\'s a very tough question to answer. \"Bach shows us what it\\'s like to be the universe, Mozart shows us what it\\'s like to be human, Beethoven shows us what it\\'s like to be Beethoven.\" It might interest you to know that Bach was not a widely performed composer until about 70 years after his death when he was revived by a conductor/composer named [Mendelssohn]( URL_0 ), and he was only really known in his lifetime for being a superb organist. I think people like Bach so much because he was a master of saying what needed to be said in the simplest and most elementary terms. If I was asked to choose a piece of music to accompany a minimalist piece of art, I\\'d probably choose a work by Bach. I can\\'t really think of any other composer that was able to do this to the extent that he could. Another way of looking at why Bach has remained so popular is that Mozart himself was heavily influenced by Bach\\'s music (Before Bach was even popular!). (A small, interesting sidenote. Bach\\'s son (J.C. Bach) actually met the 8 year old Mozart and taught him a lot about symphonic writing). One of Mozart\\'s students reported that Mozart ALWAYS had a copy of the [Well Tempered Clavier]( URL_5 ) open at his piano, and it\\'s widely agreed that Mozart would not be the extraordinarily talented composer he\\'s perceived as today had he not studied Bach\\'s contrapuntal (multiple melodies playing at the same time) writing. I guess what I\\'m saying is that perhaps a contributing factor to why Bach has become even more popular is because he lives on so prominently in the music of virtually every composer that came after him, in addition to having written such well crafted and beautiful music. The same can be said for Mozart and Beethoven. Mozart is my personal favorite of the three. It\\'s very hard to describe why, but his music feels so perfect and yet so humanly imperfect at the same time. There\\'s so much drama but there\\'s so much inner peace at the same time. He was able to do very complex and intricate things, but they were always contained in a deceptively simple package. Words fail me in describing him justly, so I\\'d just point you towards the [Act 1 finale of Don Giovanni]( URL_7 ), or if you\\'re not into opera, perhaps the [finale of his 23rd piano concerto]( URL_4 ). I could start listing hundreds of examples, so I\\'d better move on... :P Beethoven was highly influenced by both Mozart and Bach, and Beethoven influenced virtually every composer that came after him. I\\'d point you towards [this wonderful video]( URL_1 ) for a great explanation of why Beethoven is so great. Beethoven is mostly remembered because he was really the first composer to explicitly write music to express **himself**, which was really a revolutionary idea. He was also a master and a pioneer at a thing which we call \"motivic\" development. An example of this can be found in his [Fifth Symphony]( URL_3 ). EVERYTHING, without exception, in that symphony is built from that basic four note motif, which I think makes it feel incredibly organic and natural, which is why it appeals to us so much. With regards to there being a well defined best out of the three; In all the \"[Top 100 classical composers]( URL_6 )\" lists I\\'ve seen, it\\'s pretty much unanimous that Bach, Mozart and Beethoven will be the top 3 in varying orders. You really need to listen to the music and figure out for yourself which one is the best to you. While Mozart is *my* personal favorite, I\\'d have to rank Bach as #1. Look, ultimately, if you don\\'t like Mozart, Bach or Beethoven, that\\'s absolutely fine. There\\'s nothing wrong with you, you just have tastes. Go and explore and figure out what music you like and enjoy it. The best composers are the composers that **you** enjoy the most. I\\'m sorry if my answer was a little long and wandering, but this isn\\'t an easy question to answer. If you\\'re interested in learning more about classical music, I\\'d point you towards this[excellent set of lectures by Leonard Bernstein]( URL_2 ), where he makes a point to draw a ton of excellent comparisons to linguistics and literature.

However, one thing that separates Beethoven from every composer in history: **Beethoven was the first man to ever make a living selling music.** I can\\'t stress how important that is. Before Beethoven, it was only possible for composers to either A). work for a church or B). work for a rich aristocratic family. A man traveling the country independently, selling sheet music for money, was unheard of. (Even Mozart, with his arguably superior talent, was relegated to musical servitude his whole life. He also died in poverty.) Without Beethoven, it might honestly have never been possible for a musician to tour and make a living on his own. Thus his music is not the sole reason he has been immortalized. TL:DR - Beethoven invented the business model for selling music. He was the first man to ever make a living exclusively from selling his sheet music. That\\'s why he is unique, compared to any other composer.',\n",
       "    'Now then. Beethoven. Beethoven and Bach are probably my favourite and second-favourite composers respectively, but their roles in the history of music are completely opposite. Bach represents the perfection of an existing style: the Western music of the Renaissance and Baroque periods appears, once you have heard Bach, to be a lead-up to his music, groundwork being laid so that Bach could exist. In contrast, Beethoven was a fearless original whose music represented a total break from tradition, and the beginning of the Romantic era in music, whose composers owed a greater debt to Beethoven than to any other composer. Bach\\'s music puts me in mind of a giant automaton made of metal and glass, a powerful yet delicate machine with hundreds of moving parts connecting together in perfect working order. Beethoven\\'s music, on the other hand, conjures images of muscle and sinew moving under skin, a heart thudding with emotion, a mind alive with ideas, a face howling with pain or glowing with joy. I am doing Bach a huge injustice by making him out to be unemotional. To be implying such a thing about the composer of the Saint Matthew Passion makes me wilt with embarrassment. But what I want to convey is that, in terms of emotional expression in music, Beethoven is the absolute master. The brilliant emotional quality of his music is well-demonstrated in short pieces; take [the quiet, soulful contemplation of the Moonlight Sonata]( URL_1 ), for example; [the eerie, disquieting air of the Ghost Trio\\'s second movement]( URL_2 ); or [the exuberant conclusion of the Kreutzer Sonata]( URL_3 ). But the greatest manifestation of Beethoven\\'s expressive talent is his symphonies. [The Fifth Symphony]( URL_0 ) is my favourite, though the Third and the Ninth are also incredible. No one can say for certain what the Fifth is about - they\\'re musical notes and you can interpret them however you want - but I like the interpretation of Robert Greenberg, whose course \"How to Listen to and Understand Great Music\" got me into Beethoven, as well as many other great composers. Greenberg describes Beethoven\\'s Fifth Symphony as a battle between despair and joy. Despair comes in first: that famous theme crashes in imposingly (DA-DA-DA-DUHHHHHHH! DA-DA-DA-DUHHHHHHH!) and the following repetition and development of the theme (da-da-da-duh-da-da-da-duh-da-da-da-duhhh etc.) sounds like a roiling hurricane of anxieties plaguing the soul of the artist. But what\\'s this? At 1:21 (if we go by the video linked above), in comes something completely different: the music becomes calm, lyrical, gentle. But it\\'s not long before the ominous, anxious music from the beginning is back, and the first movement becomes a series of mood swings between fear and hope, with fear having the last word. With the second movement, which comes in at the nine-minute mark on the video, we return to hope with a sumptuously beautiful piece of music. Enjoyment is back in the life of our previously despondent artist; a reason to live has been discovered. But despair has not been conquered yet. The third movement (19:35 on the video) comes in with a winding, sinister tune on the cellos that brings all the foreboding of the symphony\\'s first moments rushing back, and then the horns blast a fanfare that Greenberg calls the \"hunting-horns of hell theme\". Our artist\\'s problems haven\\'t gone away! They were lying in wait to knock him flat again, just as he was beginning to feel good about life! But then, in the middle of the third movement at 21:36, a new melodic theme comes in that sounds cheerful, energetic, lively. From here on, joy gains and gains in strength while despair recedes further and further into the background. In the fourth movement, which we transition into at about the 25-minute mark, the little echoes of the earlier ominous themes sound like nothing more than a fading memory, while the mounting sense of excitement causes the piece to build to a greater and greater intensity of joy all the way to the loud, triumphant final chord. Beethoven knew all about despair. He was a professional musician and composer who was going deaf and feared that his livelihood would be destroyed by the condition. That a man who knew misery so well could write a piece which conveys such joy is the most convincing argument to go on living and striving, even in one\\'s worst moments, that I have ever heard. I\\'m not even half conveying how wonderful it is. It\\'s music like this that makes people consider Beethoven to be one of the best composers, probably *the* best composer, in human history.',\n",
       "    'Bach is considered great because of his mastery of counterpoint, which is music that features distinct melodic lines woven together so that they harmonise. Most modern music has one clear melody that we can follow, and everything else around it exists to provide the melody with harmonic context. But in Bach\\'s music, each note of the harmony forms part of a melody line of its own, running at the same time as all the others. Bach didn\\'t invent counterpoint; it was already a well-established idea before he was born. But the skill, ingenuity and creativity with which he composed his counterpoint music is unmatched by any other composer, alive or dead. Take his Fugue for Six Voices from the Musical Offering, for instance. It was composed for the piano, but the best way to understand its incredible intricacy is to watch a six-piece group playing it. I\\'m going to link to the video in a moment, but first let me tell you what I want you to notice. The first voice (here played on a viola) comes in playing the theme of the fugue, a little melody that goes up for four notes, drops suddenly, does a long descent from high to low in little steps, then does another quick climb and drop and ends up back on the note it started from. As soon as the viola finishes playing the theme, it\\'s time for another voice to enter - a violin in this version - playing the same theme but starting from a different note, in this case a higher note. But the first voice doesn\\'t stop: it dances around the second voice creating harmonies by playing a new melody of its own. And so it goes: as each new voice enters, the others dance around it and each other, creating gradually more complex harmonies as the number of voices increase, so that when the last and lowest voice comes in, it\\'s sustaining a structure of five different melodies above it. The fact that they all sound logical and harmonious together is testament to Bach\\'s genius: a structure made up of six melodies would sound chaotic in the hands of any ordinary composer, and indeed fugues for six voices are pretty rare. Once all six voices have entered by playing the theme, they are free to go wherever Bach wants them to go. But he doesn\\'t let us forget what this fugue is based on: bits and pieces of the theme turn up everywhere, sometimes tricking us into thinking we\\'re going to hear the whole theme again before suddenly veering off in a different direction. Finally the theme thunders back in again to bring the fugue to its conclusion. So here it is: [J. S. Bach\\'s Fugue for Six Voices from the Musical Offering, played by the Croatian Baroque Ensemble]( URL_1 ). I\\'ll also throw in a link to the cantata [\"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme\"]( URL_0 ), just because it\\'s one of the most joyful and sublime pieces of music I\\'ve ever heard.

This was a bit difficult for programmers to write and read, and prone to mistakes so programmers started using mnemonics and software that would then translate them into machine code. Eg instead of putting an operation code 123 you would put \"ADD\" word. This was then called assembly language. It was still working on CPU level, but the code was more readable and easier to write. Later people realised that some operations are used frequently and always looks the same, so they included them in the translation software / in the compiler.

There can actually be a long time between arrest and trial and there is only one way to guarantee that the accused shows up to trial: jail them in the interim. Since a person not yet tried is technically innocent, and since this interim period can be long (and historically has been used to jail people indefinitely), we have the option of releasing them until the trial. But we still need a way to ensure they show up for trial, so we have bail. They pay money that the court keeps until they show up for trial. If they show up, they get the money back, if not, they lose the money (and get other crimes added to their charges, to boot). The more severe the crime, the more severe punishment the accused faces, and the greater incentive is needed for them to appear to face that possible punishment, so we have higher bails for those crimes. EDIT: Some answers to common replies: 1. Yes you can get the money back even if you are guilty, but the government will take from that fees, fines and other penalties. Since it's money you would owe anyway, them taking it out of money they are already in possession of is the same thing as giving you all the money back and then just taking the money anyway. 2. It is not a loan. It is collateral. You do not get interest and it is not adjusted for inflation. 3. Yes, this is just one of many aspects of the US criminal justice system that hurts poor people more than rich people. It is not the only aspect nor the aspect that hurts poor people the most. 4. People that cannot afford bail outright (almost everyone) can use a bail bondsman. This is a person or company that will pay your bail for you, but the price of that is they permanently keep 10% of that fee. So if your bail is $50,000, you pay the bail bondsman $5,000 and they will foot the rest of the bill to the government. So you are permanently out $5,000 as opposed to being temporarily out $50,000. If you skip trial (meaning the bondsman loses their money) they will hunt you down and find you and not be very friendly about it. EDIT2: Update from /u/wickedogg regarding bond bailmen:  >  As an attorney who works for a bail bondsman, hunting people down is not the main consequence of skipping trial. The main thing that we do is go after the people who agreed to guarantee the bail. The accused (to use your term) needs someone to go to the bondsman for him and usually that person is a parent, or uncle, or other family member. That person signs a guarantee and a confession of judgment along with providing a detailed accounting of all their assets, job, and personal information. When the bail gets forfeited I file the judgment and take the money out of bank accounts, garnish wages, and take property. All of this is motivation for the family to make sure that the accused shows up in court in the first place, or turns himself in soon after skipping a court date.\",\n",
       "    'Attorney here, with the majority of my practice in criminal law. The terms \"bail\" and \"bond\" are used pretty interchangeably. In theory, bail is used to ensure your appearance in court. You have to \"post\" the bond with the court in full. The amount is set based on a number of factors, all with the focus being on what will it take to make sure you come back to court. So if you have a very serious crime, it will take a lot of money to make sure you come back, rather than just run. If you have a history of skipping out on court dates, you get a high bond. If you have the ability to travel to foreign countries, high bond. If you\\'ve never been in trouble before, have strong ties to the community, and are intent on contesting the charges, a lower bond. Most judges have standard \"x charge = y bond\", and will only deviate from that (up or down) based on extraordinary circumstances. If you show up for your court, that money is refunded to you, or oftentimes is applied to fines and court costs if you are found guilty. Bail bondsmen come in to play when you cannot afford your bond. They are licensed and regulated by the courts. In my state, their fees are also regulated - 10% of the bond plus fees. If you have a $50,000 bond, you are going to pay the bondsman $5,000 plus his fees (usually $80-$250). That money is a payment to the bondsman and you will not get it back. The bondsmen then signs some paperwork with the jail saying they are guaranteeing you will be in court on the specified date and time, and if you are not, then they are on the hook for the $50,000. This is where \"bounty hunters\" come from. In most cases, the bounty hunter and bondsman are the same person. If you miss court, the judge will give the bondsman a set amount of time (usually 30-60 days) to get you back in to court before they make the bondsman pay up. So now it is in his financial interest to go find you. If he can\\'t, he may hire a private party to find you, or put out a bounty, because it\\'s better to pay $10,000 to the guy that finds you and brings you in than it is to pay $50,000 to the court. It is important to note that just because your bond is forfeited, doesn\\'t\\' mean you are off the hook for the charges you were facing. Your charges are still pending, you have a warrant, you will have a new charge for failure to appear, and you are out the bond money. The court can impose almost any type of restriction it wants while you are out on bail. Common ones are GPS monitoring, surrendering your passport, and no out of state travel. The system definitely favors the wealthy over the poor. If you have the money to post the $50,000, you aren\\'t out anything. Most people facing criminal charges can\\'t afford that, so they have to pay $5000 to a bondsman to avoid sitting in jail for the months/years it may take to get to trial. That $5000 is money they no longer have to spend on hiring an attorney or other things to help in their defense.',\n",

The court determines an amount of money you can give to the court in order to not sit in jail between arraignment and trial.  > Why do they attribute money to the severity of crimes? The amount is set in relation to the risk of flight from justice (how likely you are to not show up to court if not held there between arraignment and the trial). This amount, per the law, is to be set high enough that you will be compelled to not run, but low enough that you can afford it. Typically, individuals use bail-bondsmen to obtain money for bail.

If you fail to show, the bail-bond company send out bounty hunters to capture you in order to get the money they fronted to the court back.\",\n",

But if you aren't locked up, there's a risk that you may try to flee and not go to your trial at all. Bail is money that you give to the government to be allowed to not sit in a jail cell when you're waiting for a trial. If you show up for the trial, you get your money back once the trial is concluded. And if you don't, the money is used to pay a bounty hunter to capture you and bring you back. The amount of bail is set based on the financial situation of the accused, the severity of the crime, and how much of a flight risk they seem to be. The goal is to make it financially infeasible for the accused to try to run away.\",\n",
       "    \"I recently went through the court system for the first time. How I noticed how they determine the cost (at least for those of us who were involved in smaller misdemeanors) of the bail isn't entirely the severity of the crimes. Most of the time it is highly dependant on the history of the defendant. If they have a history for escaping, not showing up for parole or court, or running from the cops, then the state determines that they are at high risk of not showing up to their next court appearance. Higher risk of a no show, the higher the bail bond will be as a form of collateral to get to get the defendant to show.\",\n",
       "    \"1) Bail is money you give to the court in exchange for a promise that, if you are let out of jail before trial, you will show up to your trial. Bail basically is a means of ensuring that you show up - you aren't paying the government anything, you're giving them money to hold that they return to you when your trial takes place. 2) Bail amounts depend on two things - how much money you have, and the severity of the crime you committed. If you committed some heinous crime, they may not allow you out on bail at all; you simply cannot be trusted out in the community, and/or no amount of money could ensure that you wouldn't try to run, because you might be sentenced to life in prison or death. Likewise, if you have a history of running away when facing trial, they're unlikely to allow you out on bail for any amount of money. If you have a lot of money, they're likely to ask for a greater amount of money from you for bail - to a poor person, $1,000 might be a lot, but to Donald Trump, that wouldn't be very much. However, other factors are taken into account as well - having strong ties to the local community will tend to lower bail amounts, for instance, because if you fled, you'd have to be abandoning all that stuff. Owning a house or a business makes it much less likely you'll just run off because there's no way for you to take that house or business with you. Obviously, this varies depending on the crime. The purpose of bail is ultimately to get you to show up - if they have other reasons to think you'll show up if they let you out of jail until your trial, they're less likely to ask for bail money. 3) If you fail to show up to your trial, you lose your bail money - the government keeps it. 4) In some states, such as Oregon, bail works slightly differently; instead of giving the government the full amount, you give the government 1/10th the amount of your bail. If you show up, you get that money back; if you fail to show up, not only do you lose the money the government is holding, but you owe the government the rest of that money as well, and they may seize it from you. 5) In some other states, it is possible to get a loan from someone known as a bail bondsman. Typically speaking, a bail bondsman will ask for approximately 10% of the bail as a fee; the bail bondsman then gives the government the full amount of your bail. If you show up to your trial, the bail bondsman will get their money back, but you won't get that 10% of the bail that you paid the bail bondsman back - that was their fee, so you're just out their money. This allows you to get out with 1/10th the amount of bail you would pay otherwise, but you do lose that bail for sure. This is how bail bondsmen make money. In most states where this is legal, the bail bondsman can also hire a bounty hunter to track you down if you skip out on your trial - if the bounty hunter tracks you down and brings you back in, the bail bondsman gets their bail money back, though the bail bondsman will have to pay the bounty hunter for their services (though in some cases, bail bondsmen double as bounty hunters). The practice of bail bondsmen and bounty hunters is controversial; the idea behind bail bondsmen is that, as private individuals, they'll hunt you down if you skip out on your trial. They also frequently force you to get cosigners for your bond, and if you skip out on your trial, those other people may become responsible for the loan that the bail bondsman made to you, further disincentivizing fleeing. The problem is that this can lead to corruption (bail bondsmen make money from people going to jail, which can lead to them getting cozy with local law enforcement and judges in an attempt to get more money, as well as incentivizing them to want to push for more things to be criminalized), overly high bonds being demanded of people as a matter of course (because people only have to pay 1/10th of it), bail bondsmen making money doing something that the government should be doing itself, it undercutting the idea of bonds in the first place, it primarily being directed at taking advantage of poor people, and the problems which can be caused by bounty hunters (who aren't law enforcement officers) doing illegal things, harassing people, or in some cases, kidnapping people.\",\n",

Other factors are ease of flight (such as if you can easily live abroad, etc) and you take into account other factors that would maybe form an intent to stay such as the accuser has his business and family in the area. Bail will (should) also depend on your ability. So if you are very rich, paying a smaller sum would not decrease your risk of flight. It is a mix of the above in theory. Normally the prosecutor will have a say in it and as well with your defense attorney generally wanting to ease the bail requirements.',\n",

As the severity of the perceived risks increases, the amount of bail tends to increase, in an attempt to ensure the accused\\'s presence and to protect the public from a possibly dangerous person. Since there are many factors considered in determining the risk of releasing the accused, rather than simply a \"released or jailed\" system, money adds an element of accountability to the accused, since if that person posts the bail and does not live up to the terms of the bail agreement, that person does not get the money back as punishment for not complying with the court\\'s orders, and the person is generally jailed until the case is resolved to ensure compliance with the court\\'s directives.',\n",

There are about 30 satellites 20,200 kilometres (12,600 mi) above the Earth. (Each circle is 26,600 kilometres (16,500 mi) radius due to the Earth's radius.) Far from the North Pole and South Pole, a GPS unit can receive signals from 6 to 12 satellites at once. Each satellite contains an atomic clock which is carefully set by NORAD several times every day.  > The radio signals contain very good time and position of the satellite. The GPS receiver subtracts the current time from the time the signal was sent. The difference is how long ago the signal was sent. The time difference multiplied by the speed of light is the distance to the satellite. The GPS unit uses trigonometry to calculate where it is from each satellite's position and distance. Usually there must be at least four satellites to solve the geometric equations.  > A GPS receiver can calculate its position many times in one second.

The plane made an emergency landing as far as I can recall at the nearest airport and the woman was escorted to the (hospital, clinic, whatever was presumably closest). Another instance was a man had a heart attack, though surprisingly enough there actually WAS a doctor on board.

Try writing two different sentences on paper with each hand. Now, instead of trying to do both at the same time, write one word or one sentence after the other. You get it done a lot faster and better. This is what computers do, though they’re a lot faster, they actually do one thing at a time. It just happens to go so fast it looks like they’re doing it at the same time. Now, continuing with our human example, when you’re writing your sentences, what if you don’t know how to spell a word, or your pencil breaks? You have to stop and figure out what went wrong, and try to fix it. If you can’t figure out how to spell it, or don’t own another pencil, you’re stuck. What makes us different than computers is that when something goes wrong for us, we always have alternate solutions. For example, we can grab a pen or look up a word in a dictionary. We can see alternatives. When a computer has these kinds of errors it depends on how well the programmer made the program. If it’s a good program, it has pre-built alternatives that don’t stop it from accomplishing its task.

Africa is a huge continent but there is still a fairly restricted number of extant historical sites that are comparable. The main reason, as.many have pointed out, is the nomadic lifestyle. The same can be found in Australia, and is directly related to the climate in the region. The inability for farming to grow beyond a subsistence level in many areas of the continent is the main reason that a nomadic lifestyle remained prevalent through the ages. Those areas that have built from stone, or even more permanent mud-based bricks in some areas, tend to correlate highly with floodplain areas of large rivers, either with large rich floodplains like Egypt, or a lush forest area that still provides rich fertilisation. The requirements for making larger and more.oermanent structures are quite heavy; often a society would require dedicated craftsmen for both tools and stonework to make quality materials. Those craftsmen can only dedicate to their craft if society can provide for them without them hunting, gathering, herding or subsistence farming. With few exceptions, most areas that develop lasting ancient architecture are those with a temperate climate that support fertile soil, a reliable water supply, and can sustain this for several generations. This allows a society to put down roots in an area, building into a permanent settlement that cultivates larger areas of land more efficiently, providing. A surplus of food that can feed non-food producing workers. Most of Europe, Asia, and south America can provide much of this capacity, as well as the flood plains of predictable large rivers, like the Nile. Access to stone is the final key factor to this, which also tends to be why, despite their pre-disxovery population size, Native Americans lack much ancient architecture. They did in fact build quite large settlements comparable to European cities, however a combination of the preservation of their naturalistic cultural roots, and the additional climate struggles of north-america's varying geography and seasonal extremes, alongside a massive availability of wood, led them to mostly avoid permanent stone buildings. So there you go. The short answer is because Africa is a hot, dry continent in many areas, where people didn't have time to develop crafts not immediately associated with imminent survival, except in a few safe zones.\",\n",

Some areas, such as Manhattan and LA are, but on the whole the population and industry are spread out - which increases the cost of any infrastructure work compared to countries such as the Netherlands, UK or Japan. 2. The electrical infrastructure in the USA is woefully underfunded - there are huge chunks of the electrical network that are either so old or poorly maintained that they should be scrapped, but there is no money to do so. This is often a reason for not being able to build plants or even install panels on a house - the local grid is often at its limit and any more load would cause major problems. 3. The USA is actually one of the highest power users per capita in the world, and that use is growing thanks to increased use of electric cars, air conditioning and other gadgets. This means that more energy sources per person are required to achieve the same proportion of renewable supply that is seen in other countries.  URL_0   URL_1 ',\n",

Simple by lowering taxes on *any* kind of economic activity, they can immediately get much more of it. So tax subsidies produce much larger effects for them than for Americans. All the countries that have met aggressive targets are islands or peninsulas. Why does this matter? Because there is nowhere in Denmark more than a few miles from the ocean. The ocean is an easy place for wind power (no land features that break up the movement of pressure systems) but is also typically close to population centers, which cluster around ports. The US has a long coastline, but also an immense interior where windpower is dubious until long-distance transmission becomes more reliable. Finally, all measurements are different in smaller units than in bigger units. I could easily get my home to be 50% renewable simply by adding solar panels. But I would still have to use coal power for the other 50%. My entire *region* could not do that so easily, because any one home that wants to use coal power when the sun goes behind a cloud is parasitic on all the other homes who are using a coal power plant that can adjust its output according to demand. For *everyone* to be 50% renewable, we need to find ways to get power without using that coal power plant.',\n",

There are only two exceptions. Denmark, and Belize. Belize is a small middle American nation which spreads it's renewable energy production equally between biomass and hydropower. Denmark gets pretty much all their renewable energy from Wind, but they just happen to be located next to hydropower giants Norway and Sweden, and closely insulated in the European grid, which allows them to balance their energy production easily. The answer thus is simple. The US doesn't have hydro power plants. No conspiracy, simply geology.  URL_0 \",\n",

Here is an example: Denmark makes about 35 TWh of power a year, using about 8 fuel-burning power stations and 13 wind farms. 100% renewable electricity could be achieved by replacing those 8 fuel-burning power plants. The US, however, makes about 4300 TWh of power a year, using around 7000 power plants. Of those plants, about 1200 are renewable (mostly wind or hydroelectric) and 5800 are non-renewable (mostly natural gas, oil, or coal). To reach 100% renewable electricity we would have to replace 5800 power plants instead of 8. In short, the United States has MANY more power plants than these small countries, and replacing them with renewables is a far, far bigger task, and involves dramatically more effort.

If the United States government NEEDED to get it done sooner it would; but there isn't the political and social pressure needed to serve as a catalyst to counter the inertia of so many powerful people with a vested interest in riding the oil cash cow as long as possible. Nuclear energy is also hugely unpopular, for reasons I don't really agree with but it means a huge part of that renewable energy pie is off limits for the most part.

Stand up punching seemed slow and ponderous, so it was necessary to mix in some more sophisticated fighting. Also, the way audiences viewed their movie heros changed. You used to have John Wayne cowboy type leads, who were better than everyone else by virtue of being special. He won his fight because he was always stronger, tougher, and luckier than mere supporting roles, that all the reason the audience needed. Today's heroes are usually a little more nuanced.

Prior to the advent of film as a medium staged combat was only really used for theater, and the main type of serious violence that plays had been using for centuries was fencing. (pummeling someone would have been more slapstick, and likely would have just used an actual slapstick for the fight) This meant that the fight choreographers of the early to mid 1900\\'s were educated in how to put together a sword fight, with any hand to hand combat as a bit of an afterthought. (there would also be firearms used, but that was more of an armorer\\'s department, rather than a fight choreographer). In the 1900\\'s brawling became the primary way to have physical violence outside of gunplay, as swords were no longer a modern weapon. Unfortunately we did not have the stage combat \"technology\" to choreograph these fights well. The blocking techniques used in film also did not lend themselves to good fight scenes. (the scene of shatner punching the alien: look at how close their heads are to one another, there is no room for a realistic punch) In film people\\'s faces are generally closer than people naturally get to each other, so that they can both be in the same frame. With the advances in stage violence over the last 60ish years we now have some good western brawler choreography styles to use for knock-down drag-out fights, which also works well for simulating domestic violence, and we have a new generation of fight choreographers who can do a brawl as well as they can do a sword duel.',\n",

Sound actually makes a huge impression on how you perceive action, and can even convince you to \"see\" things that aren\\'t there (like, for example, a punch that would shatter a normal person\\'s skull if it were real). Additionally, modern sound recording and production for films is light years more sophisticated, both in terms of equipment and in terms of technique, than it was in the 40\\'s-70\\'s.

In science, the article might be the details and results of a new experiment; in a history journal, it might be a new theory based on re-reading a ton of old documents, etc. If we restrict the discussion to science, then articles can be of several types. A common set of types are: Full papers (a long detailed description of a new experiment/trial, and its results, together with how they affect current theories), short communications (a brief description of a new result, not important or complicated enough to need a full paper), reviews (an article going through all the existing papers on a particular subject, pointing out which are good and bad, which results are reliable and which might not be, and producing an overall conclusion about the current theories, etc.) Anyone can write a paper and submit it to a journal. Editorial staff will then look at the paper, make sure it is something that journal readers might be interested in, and then find some volunteer experts to review it. Typically, the experts will be authors who have previously submitted papers on a similar topic to the journal and had them accepted for publication. However, they might also be personally recommended to the editors, or the editors may be familiar with their expertise from other journals. The reviewers will then review the paper, and make a recommendation to the editor as to whether it should be published or not. So, who reads the journals? Anyone that is interested in the up-to-date knowledge. For science journals, that would be scientists working in that field. For medical journals, it would be doctors who need to know about the latest advances. The journals are essentially a method for people to get their results and theories out to the wider world. Some are old and have a long and prestigious history, taking care to make sure that the reviews are of good quality and that the papers are interesting and important. Some, especially these days, are little more than scams which will publish anything if you pay their \"publication fee\". The older ones were typically weekly or monthly printed magazines, but these days people prefer online subscriptions; with many of the new low cost journals being online only.

Some papers might have such a huge impact that they're read generally by all biologists or chemists or whatever, but most research isn't getting published in Nature or Lancet or the handful of other very popular journals. What happens in biomedical science, which is what I know, is that papers published in associated journals gets a unique ID and entered into a database called pubmed. As other scientists, when we're learning about something or coming up with an experiment, we use these databases to find and read all the related work that's been done.

A lot of journals are behind paywalls and a single article can cost $50, so those are pretty much restricted to students and facilities with access. The other point a lot of people made already is that a lot of published papers are reviews. These are basically written as introduction to something and a review of all the prior research.

       "  'output': {'604020': [\"As others have posted here, not just humans but many animals tend to birth one offspring, while many others have lots of babies at one time. As a species you can adopt one of two strategies: you can have lots of babies so that even if some die, others will hopefully survive to the age where they can reproduce. The disadvantage of this is that you have to spread your love around - you can't spend as much time and attention on each one as you could if you had fewer kids. The other strategy is to have few babies, and pour as much time, love and attention to them as possible to ensure they will survive. These two strategies are known as [r/K selection theory]( URL_0 ). Species like fruit-flies that have tons of kids are r-selected. This is generally a better strategy in an unstable environment. Humans, cows and others that normally have one kid at a time are K-selected. This strategy is better in a more stable environment, where you can expect to live long enough to reproduce again later in life.\",\n",
       "    'Lots of animals have single offspring at a time. Most larger hoofed mammals as well as many apex predators and larger primates typically have single births.',\n",
       "    'Among other things, the way our hips are built. Being bipedal, our hips bear a lot of weight from our body. To compensate for the increased stress as compared to other animals, female birth canals are much smaller. This means that human births are comparatively more painful, traumatic, and dangerous than the births of other animals. Since even one at a time can create massive trauma, multiple births at one time could easily be lethal. This likely created a very strong selective pressure for women who did not have multiple births at once, since they could have more children over time than their rivals, who would be much more likely to die and thus have fewer total offspring.',\n",
       "    \"In general, it has to do with survivability. Single births mean the parent has more time for that individual. Multiple births mean less time per offspring. Each individual offspring therefore has a lower chance of survival, but as a group, there is a good chance that at least one will survive. Seems like the larger mammals tend to have single births. For example, polar bears and elephants usually have single births. But that doesn't always equate to larger offspring. Polar bear cubs are exceptionally small at birth. I'm not positive, but I'm thinking ounces. They are also denned up at the time of birth though and are a more decent size by the time they emerge. Elephant calves are a couple hundred pounds at birth. Larger size at birth or by the time they emerge from the den and risk encountering predators also helps with survivability.\",\n",
       "    \"It's because of our development. Lots of animals are exactly the opposite for them it's just spray and pray they simply produce hundreds or thousands of offspring and hope a few make it. For example sea turtles you see the hatchlings running down the beach and most of them don't make it, but they have so many hatchlings that it keeps the species going. There's no parental involvement the young are independent from day one. Higher mammals are different it takes us a long time to mature. This is especially true for humans because of our brain development. So we have one or two offspring at a time but invest massive time and resources into raising them.\",\n",
       "    \"It's a matter of resource management. Some species dedicate more resources to few offspring to give better odds of survival. Other species dedicate fewer resources to more spawn and count on the survival of some to carry on the legacy. Evidence of this, species with fewer offspring tend to have longer gestation periods and care for their offspring longer after birth while those that produce more spawn tend to leave their spawn sooner. Also, those that invest more resources tend to have offspring that take longer to mature into independence while those that have more offspring tend to develop more quickly.\"]}},\n",

If it wasn\\'t a mansion, would my house have been less expensive?\" During sleep, it is believed that memories formed during the day are being stored away into long term memory. Dreams are believed to be the signals that the brain picks up on and erroneously interprets as perception during this process. It seems as though stressful memories are more likely remembered, so you know how to deal with stress later, and dreams are accidentally a way for you to practice dealing with stress without the risk of failure. Also, scientists performed experiments with people falling asleep hooked up to brain scanners. During early stages of sleep, they were woken up, but they reported that they didn\\'t feel like they even began to fall asleep at all. This suggests that awake/asleep is more like a sliding scale, and we don\\'t always know how conscious we are.

And so you have to ask... \"if there is no evidence for it, why do I automatically assume it must be real?\" *Everything* you perceive is as a direct result of external stimuli. So even your innermost thoughts have an outward cause, and that cause is ultimately out of your control. Even something as simple as \"do I eat the chocolate now, or wait until after dinner?\" will be decided by a million other factors, such as subtle gene influences, the way your personality has been shaped over the years, your metabolism, the time of day, the weather, maybe some \"fat joke\" comments someone made about you, etc. He comes up with a very simple experiment to try and demonstrate this: * Think of *one* person you know, and concentrate on their name. Now, explain why you chose *that* specific person, rather than the dozens and dozens of other people you know. Most people want to say \"Well... I just chose them!\" but neuro-physiologically, we know that\\'s not true. That memory is *manufactured* by your brain, and you are merely the recipient of it.

Let\\'s start simple, and build from there. \"If I release a ball in mid-air, then it will fall to the ground\". Because we have an extremely good approximation for the laws of motion, we can calculate the speed at which the ball will fall, how it will accelerate, how long it takes to fall and how high it might bounce, if we are supplied will all the relevant data. That ball has no choice in the matter. Once set in motion under certain parameters, it will not deviate from its fate. Taking this one step further, if you imagine a snooker table with the balls set up. If I hit the cue ball at an object ball, I can largely predict what will happen, depending on the angle I strike the object ball, its distance to the cushions, etc. Again, once I hit the cue ball, there is only one way in which things will play out. The balls, again, have no free will and no say in the matter. However, in this case I do not have all the data I need to calculate exactly what will happen. I don\\'t know exactly how much force I\\'m using on the ball, I don\\'t know the exact spin and angle, and I don\\'t know what small unevenness there may be on the table and cushions. But even though I can\\'t predict what will happen, the result is already defined because of the conditions that are present.

Of course, what you want isn't magically free of the casual order, but so what? Choosing, desiring, and so on aren't being magically free of the causal order, but freedom isn't magical.

       "    \"The question of free will versus pre-determination is an ancient one, and one that I have personally devoted a large portion of my life understanding. After years of pondering the implications of the various schools of thought, I was able to prove through a series of thought experiments and mathematical formula that both states exist at the same time and in harmony with each other. While I can not explain Sam Harris theory in the manner you have requested, I can provide you with an accurate description of free will based on the physical universe without the problem of human perception tainting the process. Imagine an ancient alien race from another universe, a universe that ended it's natural life long before our universe came into being. This alien raced was advanced enough to survive the end of their universe and became transcendent beings that went on to colonize hundreds of thousands of universes. One of this races favorite past times is recording and logging the birth of a new universe. Imagine now that they record the birth of our universe in all its detail. They have defined every single element that makes up our universe, and have a complete database of it. Using this gathered data, they would be able to create a model of our universe that they could manipulate to their own end. Using the models to create a series of simulations and given enough processing power the alien race could then map out every single possible eventuality of our universe. Here's the kicker. See while they may be able to map out every single possible eventuality, they will not know which eventuality is reality until it actually happens. With nearly all the processes of the universe, the actual outcome of the reality is random happenstance. This is where the math comes in, which I am not going to get into right now, but there are several avenues of conventional mathematics you can explore that describe the random nature of our universe if you desire more information Now comes the introduction of life into the mix, and by extension free will. Life forms have the very unique privilege of being able determine the outcome of the reality around them. Understand that this alien races wouldn't just have your current life defined. Your entire life, everything you have ever done, everything you could have ever done, everything you could potentially do, has been predetermined by the physical nature of the universe. Thanks to free will however, we as living beings have the unique privilege of getting to choose which of our potential eventualities come to pass. Of course it's not quite that simple. We are not accounting for outside influence which effect the decision making processes. For our general understanding of the fundamental concepts however it's not necessary to get into that much detail. Before I end my lecture I will propose an experiment that anyone can try at home. Go to an area with some space and stand still. Now you are going to make one quarter turn in a direction of your choice. Random chance would suggest that there is a 50-50 chance you will turn left or right. For the purpose of this basic experiment we will ignore outside factors. Now make another quarter turn in the direction of your choice. Continue to make quarter turns in whatever direction you choose. As you make turns the odds of the direction of your turns will change depending on the direction you turned in previous turns. Random chance would keep your turn rate at 50-50, and most processes in the universe work in such a manner. In fact, if you have a friend counting for you, and you made 500 quarter turns while they logged the directions of your turn, and you did not keep track of your turns, then it would stand to reason that you would keep a balanced ratio of turns. While doing this you may find that the results are not balanced for you. If this is the case you may wish to consider outside factors such left handed vs right handed. Once you have defined the contributing factors and accounted for the effect they have on your ratio of turns you will see that your turns are still consistent with the random nature of the universe. Now lets bring free will into the mix. Turn 10 times in a row in a single direction. What are the odds of that happening naturally? Now do it 100 times in a row. In doing so you will become, in your own living room, an exceptional force in the universe. The odds of such an occurrence happening naturally are staggering. Eventually, if you were to turn in the same direction long enough, you would reach a point where the odds are no random process in the lifetime of the universe would naturally turn that way. Free will however makes such a process almost commonplace. Tldr - free will and pre-determination exist in harmony. If you think you have no free will turn around in a circle a hundred times in a row.\",\n",
       "    'Sam\\'s biggest mistake is in NOT clarifying his point; that demonstrating vulnerabilities in free will, as he has done, doesn\\'t necessarily leave us with determinism. Instead of \"pick a city or movie... now why did you choose that?\" Sam should just go \"choose to feel a strong emotion, like your first kiss.\" You can\\'t just will emotions. Emotions heavily influence cognition. Congnition precedes behavoir. Behavior is the movement of your body. Thus, if you can\\'t perfectly control your emotions, you can\\'t perfectly control your body, but you can control it to a large extent. In this world you are not FREE. You are CONSTRAINED. I believe you retain a degree of control. Determinism means there is only one future for all of us: the future was determined at the beginning of time and we are simply bystanders watching it unfold. I disagree. I see us as being able to shape the future, not perfectly, and within many limits. On the first day of existence, I don\\'t believe it was preordained that one day a race of men would become self aware on Earth and invent Cheese Whiz. If determinism is true, then Cheese Whiz was always destined to be. I think man made Cheese Whiz because he chose to. Why we like cheese is a result of evolution selecting tongues that find cheese to be desirable. We didn\\'t choose to like cheese, but we did choose to satisfy that need creatively. Creativity is an act of free will. In American, you are not free to do whatever you want. Yet you aren\\'t a slave. You can set goals, within limits, and achieve some of them in time. I think our brains work this way. We exert will over our bodies, despite the bodies needs and limits. We don\\'t have free will. We have constrained will.',\n",
       "    '*Compatibilism* is the view that free will is compatible with determinism. Sam Harris is an *incompatibilist*, meaning he believes that free will and determinism are not compatible. The two sides don\\'t actually disagree about what happens, their disagreement comes from using different definitions of \"free will.\" The compatibilist definition of free will is that you are the cause of your actions (as opposed to someone else). So even is the electrical impulses in your brain are fully determined, they\\'re still you, so you have free will. Sam Harris\\'s definition of free will is the sensation we have that there are multiple ways we can act in the future, and at any point in the past, we could have acted differently than we did. Whether or not we call it free will, it\\'s true that that sensation is an illusion. Sam harris argues that his definition of free will is the better one, because he claims that it it what normal people (i.e. people that don\\'t talk about free will for a living) mean when they talk about \"free will.\" Why would you chose a definition of free will that doesn\\'t imply that there are multiple ways you can act.',\n",

No one has the capacity to put all the variables of reality together in order to determine one's actions, so it's a moot point. So long as we're all on an even playing field such as we are now, the practical aspect of free will is perfectly intact and well. Influencing isn't controlling, and so long as that's all we're capable of, free will, for all intents and purposes, does exist. Obviously the reality is we're in a relatively discrete closed system (planet earth), so the system should be map-able and predictable. So the idea of true free will is a pretty silly notion. Although I do wonder how Sam Harris would respond to a quantum idea of human will. What if our decision making processes involve quantum superpositions? That might be a very strong argument for free will. We only think there isn't free will because we're constantly measuring so we only see discrete states.\",\n",

Your original view of the future, that the ball would roll down the hill, was false. It was NOT going to roll down the hill because in the future you stop it.

Because it is finite, it is possible to predict every position of every atom that literally determines what you do, what you think, etc. So if you can predict the position or how these atoms act would you not be able to completely predict what someone will do in the future? In the same respect, because there is a finite combination of atoms in the brain (although massively large) then it must be limited. If something is limited can it be considered \"free will\"?

A lack of research exists on the subject simply because the instance occurs infrequently amongst those that have reported experiencing it. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint this experience in someone and analyze the electrical signals in the brain. My favorite theory encompasses the idea that deja vu is essentially a delay in short term memory storage; similar to that of a computer's CPU telling the ram to store an amount of data, but the process is stalled briefly due to a hang up with other processes. The result, is an interesting feeling of 'hearing something' or 'seeing something' that is 'familiar' when in reality your brain is just playing catch up with your short term memory storage process.

It\\'s front and center in your mind for a little while, but it\\'s not something you commit to the third type of memory. Long term. It\\'s the name of your husband or wife, or your native tongue.

Jamais vu is like deja vu, except when you feel as if you remember something you\\'re experiencing now with deja vu, jamais vu makes familiar things seem foreign.

As a result, a lot of states (especially out west) implemented artificially low speed limits and enforced them with \"wasting a natural resource\" tickets that charged as little as possible and allowed the state to say they were doing something. As a result, you got a culture of taking speed limits as more suggestion than law. In 1989 Montana, for example, anyone caught going under 90 but above 65 could expect a $5 fine, payable on the spot. Additionally, people tend to drive at a speed they feel comfortable at based on traffic, road quality, and surrounding obstacles. Things like trees, street parking, and pedestrians/bicycles tend to make people drive slower and open roads have the opposite effect. States, cities, and counties realize this and will do things like lower a speed limit right before a town and have a cop there to write tickets (the government keeps the fines).',\n",

Once we won our independence, immigration from all sorts of countries exploded and this encouraged that independent, diverse spirit further. Very distinct groups formed and I believe this prevented a universal adherence to rules imposed on the people by the state governments. This in turn affected the overall culture of the average American. According to a lot of Europeans, Americans are somewhat disorganized and chaotic.

He was the entire freaking RENAISSANCE of bullshit. Pretty much from the moment he learned to talk, he started making shit up. If you want an inside look at his life, read \"Bare-faced Messiah\" by Russell Miller. In the 1960s, Scientology was under heavy government scrutiny for their questionable activities. There was even at least one FBI raid at Scientology headquarters in LA in the old days. As it quickly became obvious to the government that Scientology was nothing more than a money-making scam, the IRS even revoked their religious status. But Hubbard just ignored that and continued to pay no taxes, running up staggering interest and penalties, all the while staging a HUGE string of lawsuits against the IRS, as well as engaging in their standard harassment, blackmailing, and other nefarious activities on IRS agents and administrators. Finally, after some 30 years of this, the IRS had been so beaten down (yeah. Stop and read that again: *the IRS had been cowed by harassment*) that David Miscavige was able to walk into IRS headquarters unannounced one day in the 90s, demand a meeting with the commissioner of the IRS...and get it. So the CoS and IRS met to hash out a solution both could live with. Remember that scene in Godfather 2? \"Here\\'s my offer, Senator: nothing.\" Yeah, it was just like that. The IRS said, \"if we drop this, will you stop the harassment?\" Miscavige said, \"like a faucet turning off.\" And that was that. The IRS caved. But wait, it gets better. First off, by this time, as filthy rich as the CoS was, the interest and penalties they owed were MUCH higher. If the IRS had pushed forward, they could have ENDED Scientology. Wiped it off the map. But not only didn\\'t they do that--CoS agreed to pay some chump change fine--but they let the CoS write the new rules about how the CoS\\'s religious status would be viewed (short version: any new thing they pull out of their ass in the future is automatically religious). AND they got the IRS to agree to put pressure on foreign governments (like Germany) to restore its religious status. The IRS got...nothing, except the creepy Scientologists hanging around their homes vanished. So today, it\\'s that locked-in religious status that protects them. Even though the religion part is all Xenu this and \"you\\'re a reincarnated clam\" (seriously) that, they can go toe to toe with any \"real\" religion on goofiness. You think a couple of Mormon FBI agents who try and raid a Scientology office in Salt Lake City are gonna last two minutes arguing about \"bullshit religious beliefs?\" Other religions impose harsh conditions on their followers to \"spiritually cleanse them.\" The most devout followers of other religions perform extraordinary service for the church while living in poverty themselves. If you tried to take down Scientology as a religion, you\\'re going to take pretty much every OTHER religion down with it. If the FBI raided Gold Base to \"free\" the poor sods eating garbage scraps in the RPF dungeons, every single one of them would indignantly report that they were there of their own free will. Actually, Miscavige\\'s wife (who used to be the Goebbels to his Adolf) has not been seen in public since 2007, and there is speculation she\\'s locked away in the RPF.

Mutation is when a part of your DNA is accidentally changed (many ways this can happen). Some mutations don't cause any change while others can have a huge effect. These mutations can create new traits that did not exist in your species before. Now, as populations of animals create new offspring and live they must compete with each other and other animals to survive. They must also survive environmental factors such as weather. This struggle for survival causes what is referred to as selective pressure. Basically what it means it is since it is difficult to live only the best animals will be able to survive and reproduce. (This isn't 100%, but the idea is your chances of surviving and reproducing are higher if you are a better individual). if only the best survive and you have random changes between generations then any new mutations that are a benefit to the animal will survive and be passed on to more and more offspring while any traits that are disadvantageous will eventually die of.

We start with the old machines that were just a few vacuum tubes, simple things that could barely calculate basic math. Then we get to the age of the computer dinosaurs... giant machines that would fill a room, were considered state of the art, and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Then we have the modern PC, and with it the birth of the Internet. Then the age of laptops. Then cell phones. Then MP3 players. Then tablets. Then smart phones. Now here we are with phones in our cars and frankly a ludicrous amount of technology and power at our fingertips, with new ones on the horizon. One thing you notice with technology is that when something works, and works well, it sticks around for a while. Calculators, one of our oldest computers, are still around in abundance despite changing very little over the last 30 years. Once a breakthrough happens, we get hundreds, if not thousands, of variations on that theme. PCs could vary wildly, but they'd all still have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, hard drive, floppy/CD/DVD drive, etc. Now we've got tablets, which are all flat with a touch screen that controls pretty much everything. Both laptops and phones got smaller and sleeker over time. Storage and memory consistently went up. For cell phones and laptops, size consistently went down, while with PCs, monitor screens consistently got bigger. Technology that is terrible (remember laserdiscs?) tends to fade away very rapidly. So do computers when better computers come out. Residual old computers may linger for a time, but eventually they get replaced by the new and better computers. Remember 5 1/4 inch floppy disks? There was nothing wrong with them, but they got replaced by 3 1/2 inch disks because they were smaller and held more. Those got replaced by CDs, which got replaced by DVDs. Overall, technology has gotten so much better and much more complex over just a short period of time -- only 50ish years or so. What does this have to do with the evolution of life? It's very similar, but much slower (millions of years, not 50) and much more complex. You get one form of life that has a huge advantage over its predecessors, and then they're everywhere, and eventually there are thousands of variations on that one theme. An animal is really good at what it does, even if it's fairly simple? It's not going to change all that much, if at all. Something comes along that's better in every way/many ways? It's probably going to replace the old population of its predecessor. It's not a perfect analogy, of course. But it's a great example of what evolution really is, which is change over time.\"]}},\n",

I hear it\\'s hard for some Europeans to even comprehend its size, considering there\\'s a couple STATES that all of England could fit into. From tip of Maine to coast of California is almost a week of driving 14+ hours/day, if not more. This means in order for a company to build up a strong network across the country takes a lot of time, manpower, and money. So it\\'s hard for any new companies to form, because forming new infrastructure is a MASSIVE investment which takes a really long time to recover from. Why not just upgrade the existing infrastructure then? Well, that\\'s where point two comes in. Because the infrastructure is so expensive, there\\'s only so much of it to go around, and only a handful of companies big enough to manage it all. Comcast, AT & T, Verizon, to name a few, own the vast majority of the cables that make up the internet in America. The onus is on them to perform these upgrades. In fact, the government even gave them money to do just that. Instead of delivering on the promise of \"We\\'ll take this money and build infrastructure\", they used some legal trickery to end up pocketing most of it, while not upgrading the networks nearly as much as they should have. So you\\'ve got these companies that own existing infrastructure that refuse to upgrade it. The market should dictate that someone willing to come in and perform those upgrades could compete, right? Well, turns out the cable companies have agreements in place where they won\\'t compete in certain regions. In cases where they don\\'t, they even get local governments to sign agreements saying they won\\'t let their competitors come in and build new infrastructure to compete with them (usually in exchange for a few years of cheap rates for their community). So now you have existing, mediocre infrastructure with no way to compete against it without building an entirely new network. You can see how this monopoly would be hard to break. There\\'s also a whole lot of politics involved. The FCC is in charge of managing communications networks in America, and they tend to be very hit or miss. I don\\'t have a lot of details handy, but there\\'s plenty of information out there if you\\'re interested in how these companies are getting away with what they\\'re doing. Pretty much our only hope of salvation at this point is Google. They\\'re (slowly) building a fiber optic network, with speeds that far and away surpass even the most expensive consumer level plans at the other ISPs. It\\'s not really clear at this point if their goal is to truly build a stronger internet for the whole country, or if they\\'re just trying to scare ISPs into actually upgrading to speeds that are acceptable. In Googles eyes, I don\\'t think they care, as long as the network improves, because a lot of their services (youtube, their data processing, etc) require high bandwidth that the current infrastructure can\\'t really support. Personally, I hope to hell that they expand their fiber network across the country and we finally have real, true competition to shop from. Here\\'s to hoping it\\'s not just a pipe dream :/',\n",
       "    'Another couple of reasons Internet is so expensive is because of taxes/fees and bundling. Other people have addressed the infrastructure problems, the regional competition problems, and the amazing greed problems, so I will focus on my bill and show you the components of a typical US Data invoice. At the very least it might be a novelty. **Here\\'s how bundling works in my area:** No company that I am aware of in my area is a dedicated \"Internet Service Provider\". There are Cable Television providers and there are general Telephone providers (Telcos). Both of these business started before the internet was started and to them the internet is an add-on product. So, these companies offer other products besides internet and are generally very reluctant to sell you just internet. Their goal is to sell you the \"Triple Play\" that includes Television/Data/Telephone. In any case one may be able to get internet alone, but the providers have tricky pricing structures that make it more expensive to get just data/internet all by itself. My bill is $89.43 a month. This includes $50.00/Mo for 24Mbps down internet and $29.00/Mo for basic cable service. (The rest is all taxes/fees which I will cover). So since I do not even watch cable, it seems like it would be an obvious money saving move to dump the $29.00/mo cable and just have the internet, right? Well, no because AT & T applies \"bundled service discounts\" in such a way that the internet costs go up AND discounts go away for just a single service. This means that in many cases the data costs alone are just as expensive (or marginally less expensive) than the combination of the two. In my case the internet would have gone up to $78/Mo for data alone. Three bucks more and I get cable, so... yeah. **And The Fees:** In my case not so bad considering. And then when you are satisfied that you are not paying more than you have to for service, the taxes and fees hit you. Here is the breakdown for my service: * $50.00/Mo Data * $29.00/Mo Television (which is just IPtv anyways...) * $6.00/Mo Equipment Fee (All in one DVR/IPtv Decoder/Modem/Router) * ¢12/Mo County Sales Tax * ¢29/Mo State Sales Tax **Grand Total $89.43** If you have telephone service you may add at least five more tax, 911, TTY, and other fees to your bill. But who the hell has one of those anymore? I don\\'t feel that this is very horrible at all. But like many people, this is a *promotional* deal. This means that after one year, this price will expire leaving me a bill north of $120/Yr. This means that I will have to call in every year and threaten to leave unless they keep my costs the same or less.

       "    'It seems like the answers here are going to be fairly liberally biased (which I would more or less expect). I am also socially liberal and support expanded healthcare in the U.S., but I will try to answer your question in a way that\\'s fair to both sides. In the United States, the idea of capitalism is one that\\'s been engrained in our culture for decades now. This is due in most part to our tussles with various communist nations, especially the USSR, during the mid-to-late 20th century. Capitalism isn\\'t just the idea that \"socialized medicine\" is automatically a step toward communism (although that can be part of it as well), but it\\'s the idea that more economic and governmental weight in society should be placed on the notion that those who earn more should get to have more. That is, someone who contributes a large amount to society on his/her own and earns a lot of money for the responsibility should not have to contribute as much of that success toward others in society who do not contribute as much; **the idea is that the more that is given to those who contribute less to society, the more imbalanced the capitalist ideal is, because we reward behavior that is antithetical to a well-run market economy.** Note that we\\'re talking about individuals, not groups; yes it\\'s true that the U.S. economy would be in the toilet without factory workers, but ONE factory worker is not worth as much because he is easily replaceable. One CEO (in theory) is worth a lot because you couldn\\'t just give any guy on the street his job with the expectation that he would be successful. Now, socialized medicine is an example of increasing the economic reward to those who do not contribute as much to society on their own. In this model, the CEO (for example) makes a ton of money each year because he has the most responsibility at a company like, say, Wal Mart, which contributes untold billions to the U.S. economy. This person makes a lot of money for what he does, and in a capitalist society, money equals freedom; the more money you have, the more closely you can do what you want and tailor your lifestyle to your ideal. One of the freedoms that comes from having money, and thus as a tradeoff for having the burden of national economic responsibility, is that you can purchase something like healthcare, which almost invariably improves your quality of life. This is a reward for the contributions you make to society. Now, further down the food chain, you have the middle class. These people do contribute a ton to society, but not as much as the upper class. These people do have money to spend on healthcare, but they would have to forgo other things in order to do that; their economic contribution is not as high, so they lack the financial freedom afforded to those whose contribution is higher. When they buy health insurance, it can be a real sacrifice, because maybe now they can\\'t send their kid to as fancy a school as they wanted, or live in as nice a house as they wanted. There are tradeoffs, but they work hard enough to earn the ability to have a reasonable amount of comfort and financial freedom. With socialized medicine, the upper class would be helping to partially subsidize the healthcare of the middle class; this means cutting into the financial freedom that the upper class has earned and giving it to the middle class, even though middle class citizens haven\\'t rightfully \"earned\" it due to not contributing as much to society. Since socialized medicine would likely take the most from the upper class of any of the classes, this could put a sizable dent in that class\\' financial freedom. The lower class are the people who would benefit the most from socialized medicine. The problem here is that these are the unskilled laborers and people who are either unemployed (i.e. contributing nothing to society) or employed in jobs that anyone in society could do. These people are thought to contribute little to nothing to society on their own. They are paid meager wages because we recognize that they are contributing *something* if they\\'re working, but the wages are so low that, ideally, they are only enough to pay for basic necessities-- food, clothing, housing, and the like. This is the way a capitalist thinker would want it; a capitalist doesn’t *want* those people to have a lot of financial freedom, not because the thinker has something against those people, but because their output to society would be disproportionate from what they get in return. If everybody in the lower class had an adequate amount of financial freedom, there wouldn’t be much of an impetus to climb up the professional ladder and get a job that contributes more to society. Smart people would be content taking jobs that require less work and less responsibility because their financial freedoms would still be guaranteed; a capitalist wants those people to have a desire to fill their highest sensible roles in society, not stay down in the lower class. But more than that, in a society with socialized medicine, the **middle class** would bear a large portion of the cost for the healthcare of the lower class. While the upper class might be able to take a financial hit because their financial freedoms would remain guaranteed, the middle class, which was already making sacrifices just to live comfortably, will now have to make MORE sacrifices. They will be paying higher taxes to support the healthcare of the lower class, so while their healthcare will now also be free, it would be offset by the fact that they’re now paying for other people’s healthcare, plus the increased systemic costs that are though to be part and parcel of a socialized medical system; this means more people in the middle class will now effectively be in the lower class. The middle class does not want this. This all circles back around to capitalism because you’ve now got an economic imbalance. Healthcare is a big deal, and if the lower class has it, that means they are getting something they haven’t really earned in society. The capitalist ideal is that each citizen is afforded freedom equal to that which he contributes to the nation. Thus, socialized medicine becomes wrong from an economic standpoint, and can cause many economic imbalances. This differs from things like farm subsidies, welfare programs, etc. in the eyes of many because those programs are designed to correct existing economic imbalances (and just provide basic things to people like food and shelter) rather than giving people a clear leg up like healthcare would (the notion is that if someone REALLY needs healthcare, an ER won’t turn them away, so socialized medicine would only be used for non-essential procedures, even if they are greatly life-improving). Sorry for the length, but I hope this helps; this is essentially the conservative economic mindset in the U.S. and can be applied to other things as well like illegal immigration and tort reform.',\n",

       "    \"I had a long discussion with my father-in-law about this last week. He is very conservative, listens to conservative talk radio, watches Fox news, the whole nine yards. Basically it comes down to a feeling that giving more power to the government is a bad. If the government taxes people to pay for health care then everyone has less freedom; you can't decide if you don't want to pay for insurance you have to and if you wanted and could afford better care you can't get it. Also, what if the government didn't have enough money to pay for everything? Or what about people with really specific conditions? What is stopping the government from not helping these people to save money? The conservative solution would be for the government to have no control over healthcare so that the free market determines everything. If the government weren't taxing people as much then there would be enough charity to cover all of the people that can't afford health insurance. Also, there is a feeling that if people want their state to deal with healthcare then it should all be on the state level because the money stays closer to the people who are taxed so they are served better by it. If the states dealt with it all then a lot of the bureaucracy and red tape would be removed. So in a perfect world, the federal government would only deal with those things in the constitution and bill of rights and the rest would be taken care of on the state level. The feeling is that as a nation we need to go back to that. Personally this seems really naive to me. To go completely back to just the constitution and what not would require forgetting the last 230+ years of US history, political thought, legal thought, change in technology etc. Frankly, it just isn't gonna happen. So instead we get a lot of people wanting to deregulate and have the government not help where it really could do a much better job than the private market does. In doing so more people are hurt than helped and those with the most money and power are given a means to increase their control over the system.

By removing the factor of cost, medicare and Medicaid have created a culture that ignores the cost of various health treatments. Whereas weekly dialysis was once a measure that could only be afforded by the very wealthy, it is now done for everyone on medicare/Medicaid. If you wanted weekly dialysis in the past, then you would have needed to get out of retirement, skip vacations, etc. Many people say,\"you know what, it\\'s not worth it to me.\" Now we put people on dialysis for decades and don\\'t think twice about it. Now apply this to the whole field of medicine, and you can see what the concern is. With regards to other European nations who have done socialized medicine successfully, I think many of them see that path as ending the way Greece has where their government is keeping the price of acetaminophen so low so it can be affordable to everyone, but pharmaceuticals there rely on acetaminophen profits to stay afloat, so they actually sell it abroad, so the citizens there can\\'t get acetaminophen. Tl;dr The monster is a system that ignores costs; the monster is currently hungry, but giving it more to feed will only make it bigger in the future and when it gets hungry in the future, it\\'s appetite will bankrupt the government who will ultimately resort to price control that will lead to devastating shortages that would not have otherwise occurred.',\n",

Back to art class: They make a [crayon protector]( URL_0 ) that will keep crayons from breaking but you have to put it on each crayon individually and thats annoying and slow and has an initial expens and keeps you from drawing which is the fun part of art, so no one uses the crayon protector.

The rich kids don't mind this because they can afford to pay for the new expensive crayons, but the poor kids can't and so they end up not having crayons.

       "    \"Legally, drunk people are able to make conscious decisions about sex, up to a point. It's a grey area where that point lies, but it essentially revolves around their ability to function and think reasonably. Most people would see a buzzed person and realize they are fine to make most decisions, but looking at a person who is smashed and having a hard time walking and picking up social cues, most people would realize they are not capable of reasonable decisions. Driving while intoxicated isn't the same. Once you begin driving a car intoxicated, the law does not care about your ability to reasonably make a decision, it cares only about your capacity to safely operate a vehicle. That's key, because driving drunk puts yourself, other drivers, and pedestrians at greater risk. Given that operating a vehicle is a multitask function requiring attention, reaction, prediction, and combined physical tasks, any point of intoxication can reduce your ability to drive.\",\n",

       "    \"The person who decides to get drunk, by putting alcohol in their mouth, should make the decision not to drive before hand. Most people do make this decision, that is how they plan a way home (for example it is common to check that one friend is staying sober before you start drinking, or make a note of the last train home, or arrange to stay at a friend's place). While sober and making this decision some people will give their keys to someone sober or put them somewhere safe, just in case while under the influence of the alcohol they don't make sensible decisions (e.g. lose their keys or start driving - oh dear). By contrast: A person who is raped or assaulted while drunk did not choose to have this done to them, so they did not make that decision while drunk or while sober. And it makes all the difference that an assault is a thing done to a person, not done by a person. The drunk person cannot be heald responsible for the actions of others (uhem, victim blaming?). A drunk person can make choices on how they act, and because they choose to get drunk they can plan ahead to not do certain things while drunk that they make an active choice over (for example arranging not to be at work while drunk, by doing some basic time planning). There is also a massive difference between choosing to do a thing and choosing not to do a thing.\",\n",

In the case of drunken sex, the timeline is much, much shorter. The person who gives consent is concurrently wasted, and so cannot legally consent. In most states, if both parties drunkenly \"consenting\" to sex were past some point of inebriation, the male is in fact liable for his decision to have sex, and the female is a victim of assault or rape.

Potato salad with all fresh ingredients gets, say, three days on the shelf before the mayo goes off.

So if your local deli has takeout potato salad and they say it's good for 2 days refrigerated and Wal-Mart has a tub of it but it's good for 6 days and we can assume similar ingredients ( they don't have magic mayo ) then it's a guarantee the extra 4 days come from the massive amount of added salt.\",\n",

Your milk probably has this date on it. **Best before** - a note for the customer. Quality can\\'t be 100% guaranteed after this date, so you can\\'t sue if it\\'s not up to par, but it\\'s still edible. **Use by** - this is a real one, but it only means quality may degrade after this date.

Once you open it, you introduce bacteria and humidity, and if you don\\'t store it properly the date on the package doesn\\'t matter. There are different ways food goes \"bad\" once it\\'s opened: - **Stale/dry:** The flavor or texture is changed by the air. It doesn\\'t taste the best, but it\\'s not bad for you. - **Rancid:** Oils go bad. Some oils are prone to going bad from oxygen, heat, and light. Not only do they taste and smell bad, but they can chemically harm your body. - **Contaminated:** Bacteria grow when there\\'s water or moisture. The bacteria can make you sick, and many bacteria (like botulism) make toxic wastes.

The plan would also include conditions like rebuilding critical infrastructure or building specific units to respond to specific units that the player was building (if player has x, build y) as well as a dispatcher component to have specific units seek out specific player units (or buildings) or send out all units to attack if there were too many idle units sitting around. The AI tends to be not as smart as humans because humans are more adaptable and capable of inventing tactics and changing tactics on the fly so sometimes the plans integrate a resource boost for the AI team so that they can still provide a challenge to the player. Modes would be a concept used by the individual AI units in response to orders or game conditions. For example, the AI plan might give a group of units a MOVE order so that they accumulate in a given area and then later on an ATTACK order to target a specific unit or building. Certain other units had additional other states that were possible such as STRAFE and FLEE that changed how they fought in mid-battle, and most units had other states such as follow, idle or patrol states that could change once if the player (or the AI's plan or dispatcher code) gave it a different command.\"]}},\n",

Formerly enlisted men returning home often with wives not from their home town settled in newly created suburban developments because housing was subsidized or in cities where veterans services were located. finally keep in mind that regardless of stigma at least when you look at statistics many young adults *do* continue to live at home, or be supported by their parents sometimes well into adulthood.\",\n",

It comes in two parts, though with some overlap: - a child that has become an adult is expected to be self-sufficient, so staying at home is seen as putting an extra burden on the parents to continue taking care of the child. - living at home is cheaper, and living at home after an adult might mean your career is less successful than average. In the mildest form, the child could be a student that graduated at a low point in the economy and has to live with their parents again while looking for work. In the worse case, the child never went to school, isn't looking for a job, and isn't contributing back to the household. Part of it is also the notion that independence makes for a stronger person. Encouraging a child to leave is seen as encouraging them to be more adventurous, more willing to take risks, more likely to find a path in life that's right for them. Having a child that is too dependant on a parent is seen as holding them back. And if the child takes a risk a fails pretty bad, then it's expected that the parents takes them back into the home while they regroup and recover and leave again. Note also that a child living with a parent specifically in order to take of that parent is not only free of the sigma but is seen as virtuous. It's not uncommon for an elderly parent to move back into a house with the cold, and in this casethe burden is assumed to be reversed, where the child is taking on an added burden to take care of the parent.\",\n",

Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist\\'s chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn\\'t really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn\\'t just New Age psychobabble, it\\'s certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google \"Xenu\" or \"Thetans\". There\\'s a fairly recent book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I\\'ve heard some interviews with the author, and he\\'s done his homework. It\\'s actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it\\'s gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you.

You believe that there is a huge amount of evidence because those same people that you trust told you that there is. Have you examined the evidence yourself? Have you examined huge numbers of written accounts, and analyzed their accuracy? Have you visited the camps, spent years studying forensics, and collected the evidence you need to make a conclusion? Have you even gained enough knowledge to critically examine the work of the people who *do* claim to have done these things? Have you actually looked through the body of \"videos and photos\" and considered whether they constitute real evidence for the claims involved? Have you looked at Nazi records discussing mass extermination? I suspect that 99% of the people on this subreddit have not done all this. I certainly haven\\'t.

       "    'Plato\\'s Allegory of the Cave is a possible reason. The basics of it are that the experiance of the individual is their reality, and even when exposed to the \"Truth\" of something they preffer the fictional perceptions because it relates back to their experiances. The process to accept a new reality are sometimes painful and so people avoid changing their perceptions if it causes them injury. Another way to describe this reaction is bias. People unconciously preffer to believe in a lie if it is more comfortable than the truth (IE I got fired because my boss didn\\'t like me, not I was a poor employee). There are alternate reasons as well beyond subconcious denial. For example if I told you that Nasa had made contact with an intelligent alien life form but hid it from the world, would you believe me? Probobly (hopefully) not, but what if it appeared on CNN BBC Fox ABC NBC the cover of Time magazine and every major paper in America? You likely would believe it, even though you never saw the aliens yourself. There is some logic behind that choice, but either way you cant know for sure because it is an event in the past. Your rely upon a judgement of how credible the source of information is. People who deny major historic events often cite that the credibility of the source of the primary evidence is inadequte. This in itself might be a logical reason for dismissing a source of information. Take the moon landing as your cited example. Often moon denyers will state that Nasa and the US government have a motive to decieve people into believing there was a moon landing. Since all of the source material (lets ignore the laser reflection devices left on the moon for now) originates from a government controlled source and that source has a viable motive for not telling the truth if they did not land on the moon, they cannot be trusted. Since the source is suspect and it conflicts with their personal belief that we did not land on the moon, it is easier to deny it and create a false reality for yourself than it is to change that belief. To take your example of the Bible, a person who has for the majority of their life been told that the Bible was true by trusted sources will believe that. In order to change that belief they would have to accept some uncomfortable changes to their world view, for example death does not lead you to a heaven or hell, you just stop existing. That would be a pretty uncomfortable truth to accept for someone who believed their faithfulness and good deeds would be rewarded and their abstinance from committing sins appreciated after death. Confirmation Bias is a tendency to look for facts situations or explanations that justify an already held belief. Back to the moon landing, people stating that the flag in the video would not wave in the vaccum of space on the moon view the flag moving as proof that the entire thing was a hoax (this was disproven on mythbusters a while back, pretty good episode). In either case, confirmation bias leads them to believe that the waving flag is proof they are correct. TLDR * When accepting a new peice of information as a fact, if the fact is aversive to already held beliefs it is easy to dismiss as incorrect. * People have a bias towards certain types of sources and against others. * Confirmation bias reinforces the incorrect or misinterpreted facts in the eyes of an observer.',\n",

To start off, reality is a pervasive thing. Especially the reality of the past. Every time you remember a memory, that memory has the potential to be altered. There was a woman who had fully convinced herself she was present at the twin towers on 9/11, when she wasn\\'t actually there at all. Regression hypnosis therapy was an extremely popular thing for a while, until we started to realize how fragile memory was. Lots of people wound up in jail, because therapists trying to \\'unlock\\' repressed memories of abuse in their patients would actually *create* those memories. Patients who were not actually abused would come out of regression hypnosis therapy with vivid memories of ha inn been abused as children. Really, people\\'s minds are open books, ready to believe whatever they\\'re told. So, now that I\\'ve hopefully explained *how* people can just believe whatever, let me try and answer the *why*. I\\'ll start with the religion one, since that\\'s surprisingly the less controversial answer. Simply put, telling myths full of miracles provides the people telling them with power over the people believing them. If you say \"I want you to give me 10% of your money every week\", no one will do it. But, if you say \"God created man, man sinned, and was condemned to hell. But God was loving enough to send his son Jesus to earth to perform miracles to prove he was God\\'s son, and then die for our sins on the cross, so that as long as people know about him they won\\'t go to hell. Believe in him, and you won\\'t go to hell. Also, btw, if you care about everyone, please give me 10% of your money every week so that I can keep telling people about Jesus so they won\\'t go to hell.\" Well, now you\\'re getting somewhere. So, people believe it because they\\'re gullible, and they\\'re told it because someone else benefited from telling them that lie. Now down to the meaty part of your question -- Why *do* people believe in things like moon landing and holocaust denialism? At this point, we start to enter territory where truth is like a treacherous swamp, full of sinkholes and crocodiles. There will be all kinds of differing opinions because this is an area where truth has been so skewed that people for the most part just don\\'t know what to believe. Regardless, it\\'s a real that I\\'m fascinated with, and so I\\'m pretty sure what I\\'m about to say is the truth. Repeat after me these two words. *Conspiracy Theory*. Don\\'t they make you feel kind of dirty? Why is that? A conspiracy is just a plot by a group of people to accomplish a goal. If you think about it, it\\'s actually absurd to suggest that powerful people *don\\'t* conspire to get things done. In a world ruled by money, it doesn\\'t matter how you got that money. If you look around you, I\\'m sure you\\'ll see that the noblest people are often the poorest. That\\'s because they don\\'t think it\\'s worth violating the law or lying to people to make money. Any \\'legitimate\\' business that makes a sufficient amount of money is pushed flush up against the line of legality and is usually well past the line of morality. Beyond that line of legality is a whole world of illegal business. Money is money. \\'Legitimate\\' business do deals with criminals, such as banks laundering money for drug cartels. Look at the Iran-Contra scandal, for example. That was *our own government* buying and selling *illegal drugs* in order to fund the contras and provide weapons to Iran. The whole reason they\\'re doing this is to manipulate the working parts of our society to create advantages for American businesses to prosper. That\\'s why countless democratic governments have been overthrown by CIA coups throughout the years. That\\'s why JFK was assassinated, and why the twin towers fell. \\'Okay -- hold up. You can\\'t prove those last two edgarallenbro. Those are just *conspiracy theories*.\\' Well, that\\'s true. When conspiracies are proven, we no longer call them conspiracies. We refer to them as \\'scandals\\' or the like. The fact of the matter is that the CIA tried VERY hard to cover up the Iran-Contra scandal, and nearly succeeded. The journalist who first sought to expose it is dead, allegedly from suicide, although it is likely that he was killed, and it was made to look like suicide. Things like the JFK assassination and 9/11 have so far been covered up with much more ferocity, due to the implications of people knowing the truth. So what does any of this have to do with the moon landing or holocaust denial? Those things are one of the many ways in which institutions like the CIA have sought to cover up their clandestine actions by manipulating public opinion. By introducing clearly ludicrous theories like holocaust denial, moon landing denial, hollow earth theory, reptile people, etc. etc. etc., they have been able to delegitimize serious theories.

Many of them don\\'t even actually *exist!* There are identities that are *proponents* of these theories that have been revealed to be government operatives.

       "    'Human memory is a very complex thing. Recall of a memory refers to the subsequent re-accessing of events or information from the past, which have been previously encoded and stored in the brain. In common parlance, it is known as remembering. During recall, the brain \"replays\" a pattern of neural activity that was originally generated in response to a particular event, echoing the brain\\'s perception of the real event. In fact, there is no real solid distinction between the act of remembering and the act of thinking. These replays are not quite identical to the original, though - otherwise we would not know the difference between the genuine experience and the memory - but are mixed with an awareness of the current situation. Memories are not frozen in time, and new information and suggestions may become incorporated into old memories over time. Thus, remembering can be thought of as an act of creative reimagination. Because of the way memories are encoded and stored, memory recall is effectively an on-the-fly reconstruction of elements scattered throughout various areas of our brains. Memories are not stored in our brains like books on library shelves, or even as a collection of self-contained recordings or pictures or video clips, but may be better thought of as a kind of collage or a jigsaw puzzle, involving different elements stored in disparate parts of the brain linked together by associations and neural networks. Memory retrieval therefore requires re-visiting the nerve pathways the brain formed when encoding the memory, and the strength of those pathways determines how quickly the memory can be recalled. Recall effectively returns a memory from long-term storage to short-term or working memory, where it can be accessed, in a kind of mirror image of the encoding process. It is then re-stored back in long-term memory, thus re-consolidating and strengthening it. When people get a false notion in their head, it colors all the recollections that come after it.

In fact, very very few people (none I found) deny there was most definitely a horrific oppression, that many Jews were put in camps and that many many people died. Waiiiit! But they are 'Deniers!' like you know 'climate deniers' deny ANY man-made or ANY warming or they deny Co2 Exists! No, actually most of the 'holocaust denial' documentaries ranged from very moderate questioning of 'methods' and doubting numbers like '6 million'. But I didn't come across too many who just declare 'nothing ever happened!'. Whats sorta sad is that for people who just genuinely want to learn and understand there was just such a hyper-charged defense mechanism where in one case a dutiful scientists who simply did NOT find gas in samples was pretty much destroyed and humiliated as a 'Holocaust Denier'. Another young Jewish man got to have his life destroyed when on a pilgrimate to a camp he simply pointed out technical problems with the 'holocaust narrative' and what was actually preserved. He seems to have gone into hiding as a 'vile antisemite' despite being a Jew who wasn't actually saying 'the holocaust totally never happened'.

So Saudi Arabia started losing market share in the US and elsewhere due to domestic production. Saudi Arabia decided it needed to protect its market share of the oil supply and so decided to increase pumping. When that happened, more oil flooded the market, driving down prices. Saudi Arabia is believed to be able pump oil profitably even if it is as low as $20-30 per barrel. Now, others are right that it goes beyond economic/financial and enters psychology. When oil prices kept increasing, speculators flooded in thinking they could buy now and sell higher at a later date because prices kept going up.

In pursuit of this, Obama prevented drilling on federal lands, significantly hampering oil production. He successfully fought the Keystone pipeline, railed against fracking and pursued energy policies designed to limit the availability of fossil fuels and drive up the cost of using them, which states are currently fighting in federal court. Beyond climate change, Obama defended these efforts by claiming none of our attempts to increase our fossil fuel supply would have any effect on reducing prices. Not only was he wrong, but recently he has tried to take credit for the fall in prices. There is always more to the story than this.

So you mic the amp and send the sound out through those speakers. The reason you mic it instead of going direct out is because using the mic will give the the natural tone of the amp which will generally sound better than the raw audio signal. Also it allows a sound tech to mix levels on his own without having to constantly tell you in your monitors to turn up or turn down slightly\",\n",
       "    \"It doesn't cause feedback because the mic is connected to a separate speaker, it doesn't feed back into the amp. The reason that they do it that way is that amps produce different tones depending on what volume/gain they're set to. If you like the guitar tone that comes out when your amp is set to 5, you don't want to turn it up to 10 just so that the audience can hear you. It's better to mic up the amp and then play it through a speaker.\",\n",

A microphone in front of an amplifier that is carrying a different audio signal won't feedback just because of its placement. 2.

The federal law that protects from employment discrimination says that you can refuse to hire someone based on their gender if their gender is that specific to the job. HOWEVER, Hooters has to be willing to hire male cooks, busboys, etc, because those jobs are \"behind the scenes\" and so are not protected by the Hooters = women thing. Basically, it works because Hooters\\' entire brand is based on hiring women as waitresses. Doesn\\'t mean they can get away with never hiring men for OTHER jobs, and doesn\\'t mean any restaurant could get away with it. If I had a restaurant that was 100% branded to be all about hot guys, I could legally hire only hot guys. But if I had a regular coffee shop that wasn\\'t marked as a hot guy coffee shop, I could not legally refuse to hire women. ETA: Race is not a BFOQ, so no, you can\\'t refuse to hire someone based on race. It\\'s not going to fly. ETA 2: YES, EVEN FOR A MOVIE. As I have said below, race is not a BFOQ even for movies, but physical characteristics associated with race are okay in some circumstances, and yes, it is a big complicated mess. When the law was passed in the 1960s, the Senators who wrote a sort of guide to the law (which does not carry the same legal weight as the law but is considered by judges interpreting the law) said while the law says race is not a BFOQ, physical characteristics that go along with race might be in the case of a movie. Later judges have said that this means you can\\'t base your hiring of actors based on race, but you can based on physical characteristics. In the words of one judge, \"A film director casting a movie about African-American slaves may not exclude Caucasians from the auditions, but the director may limit certain roles to persons having the physical characteristics of African-Americans.\"',\n",

Similarly, you can discriminate against black females if you're casting for a movie and you need a white male. You can discriminate against paraplegics if you're hiring an acrobat. You can discriminate against Jews if you're hiring a minister for a Methodist Church. And you can discriminate against people over 50 if you're hiring a child model. Hiring is a intrinsically discriminatory process. Companies discriminate against people who are unqualified, lazy, late, poorly dressed, combative, rude, violent, thieving, et cetera. Congress passed various laws to restrict discrimination based on certain characteristics. Primarily, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 covers age-related discrimination. And the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 includes disabled persons. The federal government doesn't prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but many states, including California, have laws in place prohibiting it. When passing these laws, however, Congress knew the realities of employment, so it created exceptions in the form of BFOQs, in case the discriminatory characteristic is necessary for the function of the job and cannot be reasonably accommodated without undue burden. The courts are always in a position to be skeptical if an employer tries to stretch the limits what can be considered a BFOQ.\",\n",

Gravity has to do with the mass of the planet, and the mass wouldn't change, or change by much, depending on what you did with the material in the hole, piled it up or simply disappeared it. The magnetic field also wouldn't be affected. Your hole is too small.

       "    'Simple answer: a perfect and in-destructible hole all the way to the core would start to spew hot liquified material through it. The gravity force on the outer layers would put pressure on the core which would force material through the hole. Edit1: I\\'m correcting myself based on the comments I have received. Edit1: The material might cool before it reaches the surface. That answer depends on the design of the hole. Edit1: Assuming the material did not solidify, the material would flow until is approximately reaches the surface. Once it gets close to the surface, the weight of the material in the column (hole) would balance out the gravitational pressure. There might be a bit of spew due to the momentum of the material. Since the core is denser than the rest of earth, on average, the material level would settle below earth\\'s average surface. Edit1: I do not know if there is a place on earth where the surface is so far below the average that spewing core-material could happen. I would speculate something in the deepest trenches of the sea but that may not be the \"deepest\" place in this case. Since the earth diameter is smallest pole-to-pole then that might be \"deepest.\" Edit1: ~~Whether the material cools and seals the hole before raining death upon the planet is beyond me but I will speculate:~~ Edit1: ~~I would guess that, since the earth we still exist, then the hole would cool and seal up before raining massive destruction upon us. But...if the hole is insulated then there might be unimpeded flow to the surface.~~ Even if there is unimpeded flow to the surface, the next question would be whether the cooling at the surface caps the flow. ~~Again, since we still exist,~~ Since we still exist, the most likely answer is that the surface cooling would abate the flow.',\n",

Second, such a hole, made the way you describe, would in effect be a continuing part of the surface (mathematically speaking), since you can't admit any part of the interior without destroying the hole. You would indeed require extremely strong tools and materials, greatly exceeding the capabilities of anything we have. If that was possible, and you were able to make the hole, then the hole would, for practical purposes, not be a hole into the earth, but a tunnel from one side to the other, around which the interior would flow (and not likely notice it, due to the enormity of comparative scale). And if you *did* admit the interior, the hole would immediately fill with whatever matter was at the level you admitted, and then cool solid at the top. You probably would get some lava and such at first, depending on where you do it, but it would seize solid soon enough, and you'd be left with an interesting feature.

Some have suggested this would cause weather disturbances, and it might. I don\\'t think it\\'d be big though. Assuming a 1m cylinder, the total volume would be about 0.08km3. That\\'s pretty small, in terms of atmosphere. 1.0x10-9 % of the atmosphere. I\\'m not a meteorologist, but i don\\'t think that\\'d cause anything other than a stiff wind for a while. This assumes a constant pressure, which is, of course, not realistic. The pressure is actually a bit of a monster. For curiosities sake, I\\'m playing with it. If you just do a straight exponential calculation, assuming the mechanics all the way down are the same as on the surface, you\\'d get 2.145x1013 kPa. That\\'s 20 000 000 000 the surface pressure, and more than enough to create what\\'s called a supercritical fluid. At those pressures, the gases would actually \"condense\", but not in the conventional sense. It\\'s a very strange state of matter that\\'s tough to ELI5. However, this is not the case. Earth is not a point mass, and the gravitational force pulling on the air column would not be constant. So I\\'ll fiddle with the calculus a bit more for fun, and let you know what it comes out to. [EDIT: I worked it out as far as I could, but apparently I broke WolframAlpha trying to solve it. So we may be out of luck here.] As for the magnetic field, I did\\'t read anything that\\'d say it would be an immediate issue. Our magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core, which is driven by tidal forces caused by the Sun. A 1m radius tube would likely not cause a significant disruption here. The core is a problem though. The dynamics of the inner core are not well know, but most geologists agree that it\\'s a solid (some imply a highly compressed liquid that acts solid, and a few other theories, but solid core seems to dominate). So we\\'ve just drilled a hole through a solid core. A core that has a faster angular rotation than the surface. So one of two things would happen: either the core would continue to rotate, and we would lose the tube pretty quick, or the core would stop relative to the surface. Not imagine how much angular energy is stored in a rotating, massive, sphere of highly dense nickel-iron alloy. That would all need to go somewhere.I don\\'t know exactly how it\\'d be dispersed, but it would be like trying to stop a huge flywheel, and the results would likely be catastrophic. Extinction event catastrophic. The last issue, all the rest aside, comes down to temperature and radiation. The Earth\\'s core is in the ballpark of 4 000K (about 4 300C, or 7 800F). There is no known substance that could shield from that heat, or any cooling method to avoid melting/combusting pretty much anything thrown in. Then there\\'s the radiation. I couldn\\'t find any exact numbers on concentration, so it\\'s tough to find an exact dose. However, the Earth as a whole is estimated to produce 20TW of radioactive energy. So I\\'ll go out on a limb and guess that the level would be past the lethal dose for a person, and probably irradiate any inorganic object going through. Let\\'s assume that all this is a non-issue, for fun. Just to examine the timeline of jumping in. Since we are ignoring the fatal pressures, temperatures, and the like, let\\'s just assume a complete vacuum. The number most people use to traverse the diameter of the planet is about 42 minutes, which isn\\'t too bad (This number would not be affected by equatorial bulge, and would not have any significant difference due to elevation changes. Height is not a variable in a perfect pendulum). You\\'d hit about 11 000m/s at the core, assuming constant acceleration (some people are saying 8 000m/s. Not the number I got, but either way, it\\'s crazy fast). Now, as you probably know, a perfect pendulum will reach exactly the same height at which it was dropped. Same for you. The elevation variations in the Earth\\'s surface vary by about 0.22%. Not enough to make a significant difference in travel time, but definitely enough to make an impact on your arrival. So you\\'d likely fall short and oscillate infinitely. If there was any source of energy loss, you\\'d eventually settle at the core, experiencing zero G. Doesn\\'t sound fun to me. However, you would also have angular velocity. Since the radius of rotation decreases with the descent, your relative lateral velocity would increase, and you\\'d end up riding the side of the tube all the way down, like a slide. Even though it\\'s straight down, you\\'d fall kind of like it\\'s angled. By the time you hit the core, all of the lateral energy would be gone. As you ascended, you\\'d now have *less* angular velocity than the tube, and slide all the way back up. Obviously, all this friction is a huge problem, and would pretty much destroy any hope you had of reaching the other side, unless we extended the hypothetical to include a frictionless tube. TL;DR This would be a very bad thing. You\\'d either destroy the planet, waste a lot of resources for something that wouldn\\'t last, or inevitably become stuck in the core of the Earth forever.

Well Einstein figured out that of you do the math (simple geometry really) the implication is that a bunch of really counter-intuitive things happen to allow light to stay a fixed speed. *Space itself warps* to accommodate a fixed speed of light relative to all observers. One of these warping effects happens in gravitational fields. At the big bang, things were really really compressed, so there was a lot of gravity. As the universe expanded, some parts remained dense with high gravity. Since space was compressed and really space and time are related just like electricity and magnetism are related it means time was compressed too. Areas that did not expand spatially, also didn't expand temporally. Time didn't pass in those places as fast as it has here.\",\n",

Now if there were sort of 'snapshots' of the universe that somehow got created and by accessing some sort of wormhole or something unproven then you could essentially time travel to that sort of 'snapshot' that was created in time, then I guess there could be the possibility that you could go to a time when dinosaurs existed and stuff, but nothing that we know currently points to that being the case.

       "  'output': {'840273': ['Well, let me try to help. I\\'m not a psychologist, psychiatrist or health professional of aky kind, but I have experienced different levels of depression through the last few years, and maybe that qualifies me to provide you some input. The main issue when trying to explain depression is simply the fact that the word \"depression\" is widely missused to identify \"sadness\". People say \"I\\'m depressed\" when, in fact, what they are experiencing is a normal reaction to a bad situation, such as the loss of a loved one or the end of a relationship. Depression is NOT sadness. Far from it. Actually, if you are sad, and can pinpoint the cause of your sadness, you are not likely to be depressed. In my experience, the word that most accurately describes depression is \"numbness\". You know when you spend too much time lying on your arm, or too long sitting with your elbows against your knees, and you arm/leg \"falls asleep\"? That\\'s depression, but instead of not feeling anything in your arms or legs, you don\\'t feel any propper emotion. That\\'s why sometimes people DO get depressed after a specially traumatic event, just like your limbs get numb after too much pressure on a certain point. The parts of you that are responsible for feeling certain things simply fail to do so. They \"fall asleep\". Depressed people are usually seen as \"sad\" by others for the simple fact that they are not feeling anything and, therefore, show no signs of stimulation. You tell them something that should be really heartbreaking and they reply with a simple \"yeah, I know, that sucks\", because for them no emotional response was triggered by the information you just provided. It\\'s just like poking a numb limb with a toothpick, and assuming that it is dead because it didnt jerk or twitch or cause that person to say \"ouch\". It is not dead, its just not feeling that poke. That is tremendously hard to explain to other people for another very simple reason: your subjective experience of life cannot be shared with others. There is no way to do it, no way you can explain someone how the color red looks to you without resorting to some sort of comparisson (\"red is the color of tomatoes and Super Mario\\'s hat!\"), which is a technique that doesnt really work since there is no way to tell if the other person sees tomatoes and Super Mario the same way that you do. Maybe the way I see the color of a tomato is, for you, what you would call green. There is no way to know. So when your spouse sees your actions and perceives them as a sign of you being sad, he is naturally going to assume that it should be easy to fix by simply doing something fun and chasing the sadness away. He is failing to realize that you cannot experience the sensation of \"something fun\", because the parts of you that are responsible for feeling that are \"asleep\". And when you tell him \"this is not sadness, it is depression!\", what he hears is \"this is not sadness, it is sadness!\", since the word is so widely missused. And then he does something that should make you feel better if you were just sad, but you don\\'t, and he assumes that you simply refuse to feel better, because he can\\'t experience what you are experiencing. Try and get your spouse to do some reading about depression, and ask him to give you some credit and believe that what you feel is different than what he feels. If he is a reasonable guy, he\\'ll get it eventually. Finally, I\\'m sorry you\\'re feeling that way. Its a terrible thing, and it kind of feeds itself be keeping you away from the world. The more depressed you are, the less appealing the world seems to you and you end up doing less and less things, which gets you deeper and deeper into depression. But there is one thing your spouse is right about: you do have to do something about it. It feels wrong, it feels like nothing is going to help because you never feel anything anyway, but you need to look for help, maybe get a therapist, maybe get medicated. Think of it like getting up in the morning to go out for a jog - it feels terrible to do it, and once you do get to it you dont feel any thinner. But if you keep at it, keep doing it even though you are tired or sleepy or lazy, you WILL get thinner, you WILL feel less and less lazy, and it WILL be better for you. TL;DR: Depression is a numbness of the mind, and you cant explain that to people because nobody REALLY understands how another person feels, subjectivelly. Depression is not sadness, it is failure to properly perceive stimulation. (BTW, English is not my first language, so please forgive any grammar mistakes)',\n",

       "    'I\\'ll list of a few of the main ones in my opinion. **Making code [loosely-coupled]( URL_0 )** is a developer term for keeping code isolated within it\\'s own little world where it doesn\\'t need to know about other methods and classes. When one developer is messing around with code in another part of the system it will have a low chance of breaking something else. Unit Testing Frameworks together with Continuous Integration. Unit testing is something that no one learns in college, yet is one of the most important parts of my job. In an ideal world, when you get a requirement, you should write a (or several) unit tests that complete that requirement within your code. For example, if you have a requirement to manipulate a property of a class you would write a corresponding unit test. Then if someone (including you) goes back in a future requirement and changes the code, you can be sure that your previous feature is still working simply by running the tests. C# Code: private string _trimMe; public string TrimMe { get { return _trimMe; } set { _trimMe = value.TrimEnd(); } } And a corresponding unit test might look like (I\\'m using NUnit in this example) [Test] public void TrimMe_Property_TrimsSpaces_At_The_End() { var customClass = new MyClass(); customClass.TrimMe = \"string with a bunch of spaces at the end \"; Assert.AreEqual(\"string with a bunch of spaces at the end\",customClass.TrimMe); } It\\'s a very simple example, All I just tested for was that the **.TrimEnd()** function was on the property TrimMe. Unit tests can get really complicated really fast, especially when you introduce Mocking frameworks, and Dependencies  &  all sorts of other things. But Unit tests gives developers the confidence to change code freely, and not be afraid to screw things up, because they have their Unit Tests backing them up.',\n",
       "    'Documentation, testing, and modularity of code. Although the exact process will vary from company to company, in most cases the requirements of the code, i.e. \"Class X will have method Y, which takes input A and returns Z\", are going to be written out before any code is even written. This in turns allows teams to work on different parts of the project and know that they\\'ll still function when put together. Say class X needs to use a method from class Y. Even if Y hasn\\'t been made yet, because of the documentation a team can still code X while assuming Y works in a particular way. A common misconception is that testing, unit testing in particular, is about finding bugs in the code. In reality, testing is an important way to make sure that code actually adheres to the requirements. If X is supposed to return Z, then you make sure to test that every single time X is changed, to make sure it won\\'t break the rest of the project. For this reason, any large project worth its salt will have a similarly enormous testing suite. In addition to this are a wide variety of software used to manage code among multiple programmers. Git, for instance, allows multiple people to work on the same codebase at once, with several ways of managing conflicts. Many companies also use what\\'s known as \"Continuous Integration\", or CI. CI will continuously run unit tests on code as changes are pushed. In this way, it becomes simpler to find where the code was broken, and by whom. Jenkins is a popular CI software for Java and some other languages, Google has their own in house CI system, and so on.',\n",

You run \"every\" test on a continuous integration machine. The system will periodically run tests, and if something breaks, it\\'ll tell you. Someone will hunt down why things broke by checking the change logs for a project/file. If nothing catches it, someone will. They will file a bug. Someone fixes the bug, and they add a new test. This is the most popular way to do things. There are a lot of different types of tests, and these different types of test change change things. Specifically, programmers will not run all tests manually when making a change, not all tests will be run as a hook, most tests will run on the continuous integration system, and not all bugs are caught.

If everything their passes, branch owners will merge the code down to their child branches and that will cause their suite of tests to run against a compiled version of their local branch.

I tried a lot of things, starting from cotton pants and long sleeved shirts to wearing linen suits (a significant improvement!) but once you tried a thawb (those white robes that look like pyjamas) you immediately understand why most locals wear them on a daily basis. The way I was told it works boils down to this: you block the sun from your skin (obviously) and the light cotton fabric can't store heat very well, so whatever of the sun's radiation isn't reflected in the first place doesn't heat up the fabric that much. Secondly, air is a pretty good insularor and since these garments are relatively wide, you have a layer of air between your body and the fabric that keeps the most intense heat away from your body. Furthermore, your sweat will evaporate and thus cool that air significantly. The cotton then allows the humidity to escape relatively easily. The combination of the loose fit and the light breathing fabric is absolutely killer, although it sounds counter-intuitive at first glance.\",\n",

So you ask a very smart, honest, and secretive kid to ask about three or four of his friends to keep their ears open, and to relay results to you. At first, this plan is perfect, after all nothing bad could possible happen. I mean, he did choose great kids. However, these kids in turn gave their responsibility to their friends and that's where the buck stopped. However, we've gone from a brilliant kid, to just some people helping their lazy friend. This is maybe about 1% of the school population whom know what the principle wanted done. So the smart kid from earlier and his select three or four are trust worthy. After all, they wouldn't abuse the information they found out just to get back at someone. However, what about the couple of other kids whom have never even come face to face with you? So now back to your question, the principle is the US government, the smart kid is the head of NSA with the people he chose personally the upper executives. The people they in turn chose are just the normal workers whom listen to all interactions done by people. Now the problem with why people don't want the NSA listening on to them is because the people at the bottom level haven't done anything to prove that they have robot like mind-sets. After all, they are human and and could very well succumb to their human emotions and reveal something important or embarrassing to get revenge on someone who may or may not have wronged them.

Surveillance is a breach of our 4th amendment rights. Surveillance on the level of the NSA is breaking the barrier of illegal search and seizure, when you start to break down one of our constitutional protections, you can slowly break them all down. 3.

Pick essentially any random phone number in your country and the police can wiretap it - there are legal constraints on them randomly wiretapping phones usually, but the the technical capability is there. Intelligence is kind of the same problem - you need to be able to spy on people because well, frankly they're spying on you, and sometimes people really are plotting against you.

Knowing what the data says you can write laws to specifically target people you don't want voting, women, blacks, students or, whomever.

Most parents don\\'t appreciate their kid having a sex-buddy in their bedroom for a whole weekend. Thumpthumpthump from the second floor becomes old rather quickly. The parents have a say too, particularly if they\\'re approaching retirement. \"Junior, get the hell out so we can live our own life and we won\\'t have to waste our limited money on feeding you!\". They want the house to look and feel the same as before they left for that one-week tour in the camper, not come home to an empty fridge and an unwashed sinkful of dishes.',\n",
       "    'Most cultures have \"coming of age\" rituals, whether they realize it or even recognize what they are. For Americans, getting a car is one, as well as moving out on your own. A lot of this is stemmed from the fact that we value independence and self motivation so much. Staying with your parents implies that you are being lazy, or continuing to be a burden on them. It\\'s similar to people judging someone who is letting their children breastfeed at six-years-old. By staying with your parents, who don\\'t need your help and are often eager to get you out of the house, you are \"delaying\" maturity. Personally, I think this stems from a couple of different things. Historically, Americans had their children young, and had a lot of them. My grandmother never went past the 4th grade and had three children by the time she was eighteen. While she was married, my grandfather was in construction and would use that as an excuse to leave them months at a time, drinking all of the money he earned and never giving her any. So she stayed with her parents. This was considered shameful. While she was working in a shirt factory, my great-grandfather was the main means of support for them, even though he was older and had health issues. She was a burden on them. In Asian cultures, there is a big emphasis on staying with your parents and getting a good job so you can send them money in their old age. But in the last fifty years or so, American culture has gotten accustomed to the idea that parents are wealthy enough to take care of themselves, so your filial duty to your parents is more akin to making sure you visit them. But even then, when the economy has required most people to move for their jobs, it\\'s commonplace that children live states away, which compared to Europe, is like having all of your children live several countries away from you. Now, we have a conundrum. Young adults struggle to find non-service jobs, and when they do, they are still struggling to support themselves on one income, leading them to stay with their parents. While they are belittled for this, within a decade or so, that same generation will have little to nothing saved up for retirement. With medical expenses looming, they are starting to demand that children who don\\'t live with them to come back and help them. Once upon a time, our society was capable of the older generation sustaining themselves while the younger generation did the same in the same immediate area. This led to a lot of our current perceptions. But now, good work is scarcer, causing people who stay in their hometown to have jobs that barely keep them floating above water, or moving and not being able to care for the family that once wanted to kick them out.',\n",

In the military, 3. Living in your own apartment while working a full time job. The terms \"loser\", \"moocher\", \"deadbeat\" were common insults heaped upon those legal adults still living at home with their parents. The reason was that apartment rents, cars, college tuition, food, utilities and entertainment were ridiculously cheap compared to today\\'s world. You could work a factory job 40 hrs a week and could afford a new car and your own apartment if not your own home. That world is gone today. Wages have generally stagnated for the past 40 years but the cost of living has skyrocketed.

Basically IMO the western culture one (note: not every western family does this obviously) puts you in a shit position at first, you\\'re young and poor and clueless. But you learn on your own and become very responsible because of that. On the opposite, the eastern one, you move out only when you\\'re comfortable financially. You live no pressure and arguably an \"easier\" young adulthood. But is that good? Maybe it causes more happiness due to less stress. And it might also make you less responsible and auto-sufficient because you haven\\'t been through the shit those 18-out people have. I think a middle ground is ideal.

Multi-generational homes are not bad and are common in some parts of the world, but (correct me if I'm wrong) usually the home is owned by the working-age children who house not only their children but their parents as well.

I was yelled at for attempting to do my laundry so that I could have clean clothes for work. I was expected to be buying all of my own groceries. I had zero privacy. And I was paying basically the same as living in an apartment. On top of that, I got to deal with my peers and coworkers giving me a hard time for living at home because, in their minds, I was living rent-free. And when I tried to discuss my \"rent\" with my mom, she insisted that she wasn\\'t charging \"that much\". So I left. I ended up getting a great apartment and my base rent is only a bit more than what my parents were making me pay them. I live completely alone, close to where I work and any company I may work for in the future. I have my own routines, and most importantly, the privacy and freedom to do whatever the hell I feel like.

A poor economy has made the last two generations of Venezuelans live with their parents longer and longer, even after marriage, as low wages, high demand and low supply of housing make getting your own place really difficult. Most people I knew back there were desperate to get their own place, but few could afford it, even with a good job. When I got married, we lived with my mom till I was approved to come to the US. I hated it. I love my mother, but being 30, having a good job, and STILL not being able to afford even a small apartment without roommates is no way to live.

His dad, my father-in-law, will sometimes talk about how silly and arbitrary it is that people feel the need to move out of their parents house, and how back in the old days, families all stayed together on the farm. Anyway, to that point, I think that was true for a long time. After the Revolutionary War, veteran Jim Jones got a 2,000 acre land grant. Had 5 kids and each of them got 400 acres of it. Their kids each got 100 acres. Etc... etc... Then, some of the kids wanted more, so they headed west, got a 1,000 acre land grant, and it all started over again, but only lasted for half as many generations.

The expectation has always been you graduate, you get a job, and then you start a family, but what has changed is the requirements to hit each of those milestones and the true cost of education. It used to be you could graduate high school, get a good paying job, and buy a house. Then you had to graduate college, but you were almost guaranteed a good job, and you could start a family soon after. Now, we're at the point where having a college degree is the minimum requirement for any career but you're paid less than the investment you put into college. So buying a house and starting a family is out of the question from the start, and getting a good job is hardly guaranteed.

Independence is worth striving for. If you're living with your parents and helping them pay the bills, keep up with things, or maybe even taking care of them, there's nothing at all wrong with that. However to make the most of yourself, your life, and those around you, you should be striving to be at minimum able to 100% support yourself financially. Main drive to stay: time with family. Again, the actual main reason is financial and general laziness, but again this isn't a good way to gauge one's life so I won't focus on it. The truth is if you get along and have a mutually beneficial relationship with your family (note the *mutually* beneficial part there), you should spend as much time as you can with them. After you leave, you'll have spent the vast majority of the time you'll have with them in your life ([check this out]( URL_0 ) for more perspective). We have limited time on this Earth, and you should spend as much of it as possible with those you love. So if you look at the balance of those two very important things, central to one's happiness and fulfillment throughout one's life, you'll see that you need both in balance. If you frame everything in societal norms you'll leave as soon as possible and get a baby and buy a house no matter how much debt and misery it brings you. If you frame everything as what's best financially you'll miss out on many of the things that make life worth living (some things will never be the best financial outcome but are still very much worth doing if they bring you true joy). The main thing is that you forge your own path that benefits you and your family the most, and don't let external forces dictate your life for you.\",\n",

For a long time women weren\\'t allowed to own property or even make \"large\" purchases without their father or husbands permission and signature. For this reason daughters tended to live at home until they got married. Fathers were giving their daughters away, away from the house, away from the family, and under different head of house to care for. A similar instance happened with men, young men weren\\'t to live alone, they were supposed to have a woman at home to care for him. That would be the mother until he got married. Getting a house separately wasn\\'t always expected, but it was symbolic of moving on to being fullfilled adults and creating their own families. This gave the children stability and learning how to cope being on their own and have their own children, while the parents get a number of years not supporting additional people. For a long time it was expected that your parents would move in with you when they get old, until the rise of retirement homes and ad campaigns focused on making older folks feel guilty about \"burdening\" their children. And once women could start getting more variety in their jobs and education, less time spent at home meant a more equal share of household chores.

Now fast forward to today, where minimum wage is definitely not keeping up with the rent in major metropolitan areas, you're already seeing more people (and more acceptance) living with their parents longer.

Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but even in cultures where families live together into adulthood there is an expectation that the adult children provide for the *parents.* Not the other way around. There is much more to being an adult than meeting some arbitrary age requirement. Truly becoming an adult means being able to survive on your own. Being able to independently support yourself and/or your family shows the \"tribe\" that you aren\\'t dead weight that they have to compensate for. When someone in their 20s, 30s, or even 40s and beyond still require the support of their parents for no other discernable reason aside from personal choice, it serves to indicate that person is psychologically and emotionally incapable of truly being an adult. A 30-something year old *child* is understandably something of an oddity in most people\\'s eyes. Furthermore, and this may just be my opinion, but if you can tolerate living with your parents well into adulthood, they have failed as parents. Their purpose is to raise you, not to be your best friend. That isn\\'t to say you can\\'t have a good relationship with your parents, but there needs to be a clear line of separation between the two roles.

It just becomes worth it to people to move out depending on how well they get along with their parents and how much they would have to spend to be on their own. If the only options are 80% of your income goes to rent or living with your parents, only the people whose parents forbid them to live in the house will be living on their own (or with an S/O, etc.) At 30% of your income, moving out on your own is far more tempting and plenty of people with great relationships with their parents will move out at that point.',\n",

I decided I was the alpha and that it was the priviledge of the alpha female to have sex so I quickly grew tired of the anti-sex propaganda of her church and the restrictive rules which prevented any expression of mature feminity or contact with the opppsite sex. While it would still be a couple of years until I had sex and a decade before I had babies, all of my attention turned toward financial independence so I could leave my house as soon as possible. I did this by working several jobs and earning academic scholarships. I was driven by my desire for sex and children but I was strategic in that I felt that I would be still dependent on my parents if I chose my mate badly or didn't get a good enough financial start.\",\n",
       "    \"Something I haven't seen mentioned is the post-WWII manufacturing and housing boom. America made a ton of factories during the war - but of course, once the war ended, these factories had nothing to do, so they turned to tremendous domestic manufacturing. Meanwhile, lots of soldiers were coming home, and if you don't have any other training, then the easiest job to transition to as a soldier is construction. Now, it doesn't just benefit the housing market for a kid to buy a house and move out of their home - it benefits almost all the markets. Because then you have to buy furniture, appliances, linens, etc. to furnish the home - which is what all those former WWII factories were now being repurposed for. So there was a tremendous media push to spread the idea that everyone had to have their own home, and that you were a failure if you weren't buying your own home and filling it with goods. It's one thing to cajole people into spending money on a luxury - it's another thing to get them to spend money on a perceived necessity.\",\n",

My wife has family in South East England, and they don't have the same luxury; it's causing them quite a lot of upset and frustration tbh. Their parents want them to be able to move out, but even a small flat is about £200k, and rent is extortionate.

It also feels really good to know that you don't live under your parents rules anymore. Like what another user stated already, moving out is a rite of passage here in America.

I found a good paying job I could work through college and paid for my housing with it. Best decision I ever made.

The first is the high-altitude EMP, which is caused by a weapon detonated many miles up (e.g. 30-200 miles above the surface of the Earth). This is caused by gamma radiation from the bomb ionizing a large portion of the upper atmosphere and causing it to radiate electrons back down to Earth. This the EMP that the people who claim EMP is a big scary effect worry about, because one bomb can hypothetically affect a huge area. The second is an EMP created by a surface or low-altitude burst, which is caused by the bomb ionizing (stripping electrons from) a region of air around the detonation point. This can be much much more intense than the high-altitude EMP but it has a very rapid fall-off in intensity. For a weapon the size of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, the damaging range of the EMP is not a whole lot larger than the other damaging effects of the bomb — if you are close enough for the EMP to be a problem, you have many other more pressing problems (e.g. being crushed or set on fire or irradiated). For much larger nuclear weapons (e.g. megaton range) the effects can go further, but are still on the order of being within the range of pretty intense blast effects (e.g. for a 1,000 kiloton bomb it extends about 8 miles, which is still within the range of the blast and thermal effects; by comparison, the Hiroshima bomb was 15 kilotons). And as others have noted, the electronics of WWII were not of the sort that would be especially vulnerable to EMP anyway (vacuum tubes vs. modern chips).

I've collected bull and boar semen and assisted with collection of stallions and rams. I'll use bulls for example. Yearling bulls produce much less ejaculate than a four or five year old bull, which is why you wouldn't leave a young bull responsible for breeding more than twenty cows out in the field. When collecting bulls artificially, you could collect using electroejaculation (using a probe to electrically stimulate the prostate), or you could let him mount a cow/dummy and collect it in a sleeve or condom. No bull on the planet likes the electroejaculation, and this method is almost exclusively used to put semen under a microscope to inspect semen and confirm that the sperm are all normal. Why is it only used to test semen quality? Because so little volume in ejaculated when using this method. Now when you get into real bull collections, where companies buy $100k bulls and collect semen from each animal twice a week- volume is important. More volume = more money. For bulls, stallions, and boars (Artificial insemination and semen collection is very rare in rams and the sheep world) - it's very common to find companies that take important notes about each individual male's preferences. Some get special handlers they like. Some have a specific dummy, or a custom-made artificial vagina. Many of these animals get into a routine that they like and, just like humans, each animal needs just the right stimulation to ejaculate. Getting their preferences right results in the largest and most high quality ejaculate. This is why collector's invest so much time and money into recording what each animal likes. So at least in the animals world, most mammals' ejaculate is determined by age, frequency of ejaculation, and tastes/preferences. I think it would be safe to assume some of these translate over to humans.\",\n",

How often you ejaculate *may* contribute - for example, if you masturbate frequently, you will probably see a small decrease in total ejaculate; *however*, it is important to note that the volume of ejaculate does not correlate to sperm count. Ejaculate contains a number of things other than sperm, especially water but also including some sources of sustenance for the sperm. You may have a high volume of semen with a low sperm count, or vice versa. Ejaculating often may lead to a lower *sperm count* but not necessarily a smaller load. Interestingly, sperm counts in semen from masturbating is generally lower than sperm counts in semen from intercourse. It seems that your gonads pay attention to what you\\'re doing and don\\'t waste as much sperm when you know it\\'s not going to be doing its job. For that reason, there\\'s not much point in \"saving up\" by avoiding ejaculation for long periods. It *is* true that the volume will increase, but not by a lot. If you need a reason to abstain for a bit, consider sensitivity - you can become somewhat numb if you overindulge and have trouble performing when you need to. The amount of ejaculate also does not seem to correspond to arousal or the strength of your orgasm. Mostly it just varies from person to person.

There are a few different operations (add, subtract, whatever) that had words, and you did everything operation by operation. This is where keyboards also started to come in, so that you could type in what you want the computer to do. Of course, doing everything operation by operation is pretty darn slow too, and it was still hard to read 'cause it was so simple. So people wrote another thing in THIS language, called a **programming language**, which made it really readable! The old ones were pretty hard to read, but nowadays there are languages like Python that are practically readable by anyone. These programs usually have their own little program called a *compiler* that converts all of their commands into machine language. Basically people kept on writing a new, more **abstract** language in the old ones, building on top of everything else below it. But at the end of the day, it all converts to 0's and 1's!

Communication and translation between them needs a communication protocol and translators. Someone makes translation programs that translates source code to run on different chips, translating for each specific chip. The same source code could be compiled to run on any chip that had a compiler that translates the source code into an instruction set that could be understodd by a range of chips. That way people can use the same source code for almost any chip. But the source code might be translated differently for some different chips. Every chip could run the program with its own set of instructions, wich can be different and chip specific and it barely ever uses a chips special unique abilities. A compilable source code has the advantage to be designable in a way that is easyer to read than an endless chain of numerical instructions that is only understood by the chip and hardcore programmers. --- The most basic programming languages just jump between the lines and lack advanced abilities. Almost all programming languages allow for Functions. Functions within a programming language are aliases for operations that are repeated a lot. Functions can use other functions within them. Functions can also be recursive by containing themself. Object orientated programming languages are different. Objects within a programming language are aliases for multiple functions and/or variables. Objects can be build of out other objects. --- Another approach is to make software to give the chip the ability to pretent to be any other chip, or to act like a standardized environment of chips. This turns any computer into a virtual machine that is likely very slow in executing any code but also very compartible and easy to make programs for. The PC version of Minecraft runs on the Java virtual machine, making it run slowly but also making it very easy to use on different hardware. The Xbox version of Minecraft had to be rewritten and compiled to run specifically (and more efficiently) on the xbox hardware.',\n",

The oldest computers actually built were programmed partly by rewiring them using switchboards. More complex programs were fed to them using punch cards (the idea of punch cards actually originates from automated looms and predates the first computers). The instructions were punched into the cards in their binary form. (yes, as 1s and 0s) This process was rather awkward and error prone, so people invented programming languages and compilers to translate a \"human readable\" language into binary computer instructions using a computer.

The computer is able to take apart an instruction and figure out what to do based on the different substrings of the instructions (i.e., sending current to different parts of the circuit, withholding current from other parts). If you want to run a program and there's no programming language for the machine, then you'll need to find a way to input the instructions manually. Storing a set of instructions in memory and then running this instruction set is the same thing that a computer program does. It just gets more abstract and meta from there to high-level languages. Basically, if you can write instructions that will take simpler/easier to understand instructions and turn them into more complex instructions for the computer to use, then you now have a programming language and a compiler. The language is the part that's easier to understand and manage and the compiler takes these instructions and parses them into the machine language (1's and 0's). You can keep abstracting/simplifying. If you want to learn more, read up on how [memory]( URL_0 ) and [CPU's]( URL_2 ) work.

Proponents of the mandated insurance say that by making health insurance mandatory, it will force insurance companies to be competitive and lower prices such that they will be able to take in more people. Part of the way insurance works is that it does get less expensive for both the company and the people they cover as more people buy into it. Now that everyone has to buy it (or rather everyone needs to be covered if you want to change perspectives), companies are supposed to scramble over each other so that they stay in business by trying to attract the most people. Thus, everybody wins; companies get their money and people get their health care. But that\\'s theoretical for the most part, but proponents have cited the car insurance mechanisms as their proof.

Glass, being silicon dioxide--not pure silicon--does not have this band structure, so it cannot absorb light as pure silicon does.

Pure metals, for example, are opaque because their electrons can occupy a huge number of possible states, and visible light happens to have the right energy to interact with the electrons in the metal (electrons moving freely through a metal aren't under the same restrictions and can interact with any photons IIRC). Glass, however, has electrons in a tightly bound state that can only interact with photons in certain bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, few of which fall within visible light. Most materials have specific energies at which photons can pass through them, and other energies at which photons can't pass through.

In real life, Investment banks often provide transaction services and advice to companies. Their \"clients\" are companies that are looking to either buy other companies, sell their company to another company, or merge their company with another one in order to increase enterprise value (this can be referred to as M & A Advisory or just simply an investment bank). Other lesser known \"Wall Street\" jobs are in Private Equity. A private equity firm essentially raises capital from outside investors with a lot of money (high net worth individuals, family offices, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies) and combines that money into a \"fund\". Private equity firms leverage those funds to own stakes in other companies, infrastructure, and more in hopes of providing returns to those investors. Others, Hedge Funds, are similar to private equity firms in that they can raise and leverage massive amounts of outside capital, but hedge funds are able to invest in conventional securities like stocks, bonds, etc as well as non-conventional ones that are difficult for the \"average joe\" to understand like distressed real estate debt. Essentially, these employees are researching, analyzing, and executing and combining many strategies including buying, selling, shorting to \"hedge\" investments and seek the highest returns for themselves and their investors.

       "    '#**First lets define wall street** If by \"wall street\", you mean the general financial institutions and markets around the world including in the United States, then this is a *very* broad question. With that being said, I will give it my best shot. - ---------------------- We have three basic divisions of the financial industry. This theory on the financial industry I learned when getting both of my undergrads is not all encompassing, and obviously one could come up with other divisions that would equally describe the market. Neither description would be wrong and this will suffice. #**Financial institutions** These are (generally) the regulatory agencies that intervene in the market for various purposes. Examples include the SEC, the Federal reserve and so on. These (mostly) government institutions help regulate the market, provide various services (like issuing money), and pursue legal action against criminals. *example* The federal reserve may raise interest rates to stop or curtail inflation or it may increase reserve requirements for banks for a variety of reasons. ---------- #**Financial markets** These are the physical and virtual (ie: internet) meeting places where the various parties meet up to conduct business. In the same way you and I have a market to pick up our groceries or buy a car, markets in the financial industry are set up to reduce the cost of doing business and to allow for interested parties to conduct said business. *Example* A farmer wants to sell an options contract on the bushels of wheat he is growing for harvest. In order to meet with potential buyers, this farmer sells options contracts for a specified price on the Options market. He may do this at the Chicago Mercantile exchange, which was famous for exactly this kind of transaction. Without the Chicago Mercantile exchange it would be nearly impossible for prospective sellers and buyers of the options contracts to meet and conduct business. Another example may include a company looking to raise revenue for planned business expansion by listing shares in the company on a market (through a broker, which we will discuss below). Without being able to have buyers and sellers meet, this task is made nearly impossible, and the benefits to this transaction would not occur, namely the business would be much less likely to expand and at the same amount, and investors would have less avenues for wealth creation. ------------ #**Financial Brokers** This is a lot easier to explain. The brokers are the various clearing house associations and stock market intermediaries that facilitate these market transactions. To use the brief example I gave above about going to the store to buy groceries, if grocery stores *as a whole* are the market, then the Shop and Save company would be a broker in this analogy. ------------------- Now that we have a Very^very^very basic understanding of the background information needed to understand the financial industry, lets start answering your questions. Keep in mind, I answer these as someone with two 4 year degrees, one in Business, and the other in Economics, both with a focus on finance.  >  Do create anything? Simply, yes. Types of services offered include, but are not limited to the following: * Trading risk from risk averse to risk takers, like in our options contract example above * Allowing groups of people, like corporations, to raise funds, including but not limited to debt and equity issuance * Investment banks provide a wide array of services like business appraisal, Mergers and Acquisitions, and identifying market trends. * engineering complex financial instruments (usually a type of derivative) to meet some kind of goal EG: collateralized debt obligations Etc From an economic standpoint, one might distill it down to simply this saying, That the financial industry allows \"Net-Savers\" (used broadly) to lend funds to \"Net-spenders\" for a return, who then generally use the funds for some end. These transaction *generally* only occur when both parties benefit more than they lose out, and everyone is left better off.  >  Are they just playing with everybody\\'s money No serious person who has studied the financial industry believes this. There are *real* socially beneficial services provided by this industry. Furthermore competition in finance is intense, and those companies and individuals that are not serious about providing value for stakeholders are ushered out or lose money quite fast.  >  I really have no idea Fear not, most people have no clue. In a similar fashion to medicine, or physics, Finance is a highly specialized field with professionals that often need bachelors degree or higher to break into entry level positions. There is industry specific jargon, lots of math (which the general population has issues with), and abstract concepts that take awhile to truly understand on the second level. It took me about a year of undergrad finance courses to really *truly* understand what the heck is going on in finance. I hope that helps, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask, and if I have the knowledge, I will answer to the best of my abilities.',\n",
       "    'There\\'s a big variety of roles in Finance. At a high level, financial institutions essentially facilitate the growth of literally every other industry there is by finding someone with money to invest in someone with a plan/project. Think small business going to a bank for a loan, but it gets scaled up and more complex with huge companies. In more detail, you have the \"sell-side\" and the \"buy-side.\" The sell-side is what you think of as Investment Banks. These are the companies like Morgan Stanley, Citi, JP Morgan, Goldman, etc. that work with institutional clients. This mainly happens through advisory and trading functions: - Advisory is what is \"Investment Banking,\" think analysts grinding away for 100 hours a week. Let\\'s say a client retail company comes to a bank and wants to raise money/acquire a company/get sold. Let\\'s say raise money for now, and they want to do that by selling equity (i.e. ownership stakes). First, the industry coverage group for retail learns everything about the company, and uses their expertise in this industry to put a value on the company. Once they do a lot of that, they hand it off to a market facing product group called Equity Capital Markets (the product meaning equity). This group sees what the market will accept and finishes pricing and marketing these new shares in the company. Let\\'s say selling these shares raises $100 million. The advisory group earns a fee for doing this, as a percentage of the amount raised. - Sales and Trading. This is what you\\'d see in Wolf of Wall Street. Trading teams are called \"market makers.\" Someone wants to buy a stock/bond, someone wants to sell, they\\'re in the middle. They buy the security from the seller and sell it to the buyer and a SLIGHTLY higher price and make a spread. They are out of the door at 5 PM and don\\'t work weekends. Clients are large asset management funds (see below) and hedge funds and shit. The buy-side is actual investing. You have things like: - Mutual funds: Pretty standard funds of stocks and bonds and shit - Large asset managers: Think Blackrock. Has many mutual funds and other strategies - Alternatives: Real estate investors, private equity investors (buy a whole company, grow it for a few years, sell it for profit), and hedge funds (similar to Sales and Trading but they\\'re the ones actually buying and selling stocks/bonds)',\n",

For bonds, Wall Street banks get together and say okay we have found 5 banks interested in giving you that money as long as you pay us back in 20 years and 5 percent interest. They give the company the money and the company pays them back over time. For stock it\\'s similar but they are basically helping a company issue shares of stock for the public to invest in the company for a fix price in which the company gets the money while the investing public get potential future return from the stock in either dividends or stock appreciation. The incentive for banks to help the company issue the stock is that they get to be some of the first people who buy it.',\n",
       "    'Hi, 15 years in an investment bank here, and I\\'m slightly disappointed with the top answers I\\'m reading, so here is my version. \"Wall Street\" is a pretty broad term and most of the big firms do a lot of things, however I\\'ll broadly split them up as follows: **1) Corporate Banking / Advisory** **What is it?** Providing advice, lending, and all kinds of services to big companies, ranging from multi-billion dollar merger/acquisition to day-to-day payment processing **Who benefits?** This one is easy... the big companies benefit, or they wouldn\\'t pay the fees. Every big multinational operating in different countries relies on the services the big banks provide. **Why do they get paid so much?** At the top end, the biggest transactions (e.g. the $85 billion merger between AT & T / Time Warner last year) are worth so much that the advisor\\'s fee is like an afterthought. If you believe some good advice will get even 0.5% difference on the price paid, that\\'s still almost half a billion dollars. Which makes a $50 million fee look like great value. **2) Sales  &  trading / intermediary services** **What is it?** This is probably the most complex to explain. Broadly it is buying and selling shares and other securities on behalf of other people, either private individuals or professional investors. That includes offering advice to and making purcheses on behalf of buyers (Broking), as well as advising issuers, creating derivatives, and marketing financial products on behalf of sellers (Sales). Finally there are pure intermediary services where a firm acts as \"market maker\" in other words offers to act as buyer or seller for anyone in the market to speed up the operation and avoid having to individually pair up every buyer/seller who wants to exchange their shares/securities. The market maker gets paid from the small difference (\"spread\") between buy price and the sell price. **Who benefits?** As before, many services have a direct fee that the client pays - so it is the client who benefits. In many cases the client is another bank or a professional investor. Ultimately, any company that relies on the markets for funding, or any individual who has investments or pensions, will benefit from markets operating efficiently. **Why do they get paid so much?** In a word, volume. Not many companies can provide these complex services, and the amount of money that goes through big banks\\' trading floors is immense, so even small percentages or spreads add up quickly. It\\'s not just traders on phones buying and selling, there are large numbers of mathematicians, lawyers, IT people, researchers and so on making sure the services are efficient, legal, and the advice is the best available. **3) Professional Investors** **What is it?** Operating funds and making investments. This is often what people think about when the term \"casino banking\" comes up. Fund managers operate funds with other peoples money, such as pension and investment funds. Proprietary traders use a bank\\'s own money, but they often have to try and manage the bank\\'s own risk to ensure it has a stable overall risk profile and is less likely to fail if there is a big shock or crash. Hedge funds use a combination of their own money and other (generally large) investors to borrow money and invest it, with higher risk but higher chances for rewards too. **Who benefits?** The investors, clearly, if the fund is successful. Everyone\\'s savings and investments are likely managed by one of these fund managers and we all rely on them doing a good job for our own prosperity and retirement prospects. **Why do they get paid so much?** They manage large amounts of money and when they get it right, they make huge sums for their investors. The rewards follow the performance of the fund and it\\'s a cut-throat world if you fail. Overall, the answer to the question of \"who benefits\" comes down to \"money makes the world go round\". There are people with money to invest (savers, pension funds, big companies with cash reserves) and many people who want access to that money (startups, governments, major corporations wanting to invest, individual borrowers). Banks help put two and two together, in all the hugely complicated ways that a modern economy operates. Everyone who needs money, who wants to borrow or invest or even just store and move money benefits from the banks doing their job properly, in all the different ways I outlined above.',\n",
       "    'You\\'re going to get a lot of bias on this one, my own included. Like most jobs, there is a purpose and it can be mishandled and cause significant harm. The purpose at a high level is to create \"liquidity\". Matching good ideas/companies with money so that they can grow faster. May work best with an example. Imagine an extreme with no banks. I own a business that makes the best tacos in the world. But opening a taco stand costs a lot of money. I could work hard at other jobs, or sell tacos out of my house for a while to make the money to open my shop, but that takes a long time. Investors/loans allow me to skip the step if I can convince people my tacos are indeed the best. At a larger scale, a proven restaurant can grow much faster if they don\\'t have to rely solely on the profits of the first restaurant to build new ones. On the other side of the bias, current wall street instruments include \"derivatives\" which basically allow someone to make more complex investments with more specific \"win\" conditions. It is arguable whether these instruments actually provide additional liquidity. Their complexity means it is easy to have unintended consequences that screw everyone over - hence the bad rap.',\n",
       "    'Former finance bro here. The top answer is complete nonsense. Asking what is Wall St and what does it do is similar to asking what is a scientist and what does a scientist do? There are many types of scientists, and likewise, there are many posititions throughout \"Wall St\" that serve a variety of value added functions. One of the most important aspects of capitalism, at least in my country, the United States, is our free enterprise system that has taken shape in the form of the various stock exchanges - NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), NASDAQ, etc. Essentially when you see the ticker on CNBC for each respective company and a price next to it, that is the share value for a stock that means nothing except the price it costs you to buy one share of stock. A share is an ownership stake in the company being discussed. For example AAPL, is Apple which trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange and is currently valued at $132 a share. When people talk about the \"market cap\" or market capitalization, that\\'s the value of all the outstanding shares at $132 times the total number of shares issued. This gives you the idea of the complete valuation of a company. This number is based on all cash flows and takes into consideration assets and liabilities to give you an accessible idea on the value for even the most unsophisticated investors, or workers or anyone to participate in our capitalist system. It\\'s seriously accessible to anyone. You can buy stock for $8 a trade on some websites nowadays. So one of the most important functions of \"Wall St\" is to help companies in the process of issuing stock. When Steve Jobs and friends built Apple, they created a company and sold computers. Their individual wealth was tied into the cash flows from their ability to sell computers at a profit. In order to grow into the massive company they are today that has created technology that most of us use daily, they issued stock, which sold off shares of their company in exchange for capital. This capital is used to rapidly grow companies, and is one of the most beautiful aspects of our capitalist system. That is why any entrepreneur with a dream, creates a business, employs people, does their best to sell the best product---with the dream of eventually seeing their company they created out of their blood, sweat, and tears up on one of those stock tickers on the various exchanges. These Wall Street firms help companies grow and raise capital. That is but one function. I myself used to be a commodities trader, I worked in oil in hedging fuel prices for a major air line. We ensured stability in fuel prices which represented almost 35% of the cost structure of the company I worked for.',\n",
       "    \"Short basic explanation of how stocks work, which is a lot of what goes on at Wall Street: Imagine you have a company you own. You think your company could earn more money if you had some more cash, but you also don't want to go to the bank for a loan. Instead you cut up ownership of the company into pieces (shares) and you sell them to people interested. People will want to own a piece of your company because you say that every now and then, you will give them some a piece of the profits you earn (dividends). So theoretically, if they buy a share from you now when it is cheap, then later when you're making lots of money, they will get their money back over time with the dividends. If your shares can be bought by anyone, then they are publicly traded. If someone is buying stocks, they probably buy lots of different ones so that if one company fails, other companies will keep going and they won't lose too much. Keeping track of all this can be a full time job, so people hire other people (brokers, fund managers, etc.) to deal with this for them. Wall Street is where many of these brokers and fund managers work. Because they tend to be in contact with each other (this was more common in the past but works a little differently with the internet and high-frequency computer trading) this can cause ripples in the economy for investors. For example if one broker lets it slip to many others that, say, Samsung might be releasing a new device that will make them a lot of money (resulting in high profits, and thus high dividends) many brokers will encourage their clients to buy Samsung shares so that the brokers can get some of that money. Then if it turns out that Samsung aren't releasing anything new and actually accidentally made a lot of phones explode, people don't want that stock any more and will want to sell it to someone else quickly so they can use their money to buy something more profitable.\",\n",
       "    \"I feel that these comments are leaving something out. Are there scumbags and parasites on wall street? Of course. But wall street also provides legitimate services. Companies need capital (money) to grow. Wall street provides that money. The main ways companies raise money are by going public (stock) or selling bonds (debt). Venture capital can only get you so far. Amazon, Apple, Home Depot, Google are all publicly traded companies and wouldn't be as big as they are or might not even exist, if they didn't go public. An investment bank helps you go public or sell bonds. These companies need money, but have no idea how to go public (or sell bonds). They go to an investment bank and the investment bank makes it happen. Wall street isn't all hookers and blow like wolf of wall street. There are a lot of really smart guys (nerds) working long hours in front of computers. These guys make good money but nothing to brag about, especially in NYC. Most of these guys can't even afford to live in the city and are laid off every time there is a downturn.\",\n",
       "    'So imagine there\\'s a cake. And when someone slices off a piece of that cake, Wall street takes that piece of cake and hands it to someone else. In that process, a small crumb falls off the piece and Wall Street people take that for themselves. Soon enough they will have their own cake made up of parts of other people\\'s cake. Then they can sell their own cake to others. They can also slice up and package their own freakish cake as something \"special\" like the daily special at a restaurant. (LPT: don\\'t ever order the seafood special at a restaurant and if anyone in Finance tries to sell you something special, run) They also do other weird things with the cake and crumbs. Like letting people bet on whether the crumb lands on the floor, or the table. Or other things like having other people buy a piece of small cake today and promise them a bigger piece tomorrow.',\n",
       "    \"Wall Street does a ton of things and it's huge. Trying to say all of what wall street does in this answer is not possible. Instead, I'll talk about two big things that wall street does. 1) Wall Street moves money from people who have it to people who need it. 2) Wall Street moves risk from people who have it to people who want it As for 1) when a company issues stock or bonds, they're doing that because they want to raise money. They want to invest that money in the business (hopefully) to hire more people or build more factories or w/e. These companies go to Wall Street (Let's say they go to our friends at Goldman sachs) and Wall Street will hook them up with the investors (hedge funds, pension funds, other asset managers, whatever). These investors are looking for a place to put their money and hopefully generate more money. Goldman Sachs will then facilitate the linking process between these two groups. This is just one example of how Wall Street moves money from the people who have it to the people who need it. Another example might be when you invest your money by giving it to Vanguard. You have surplus money right now, and you feel that in the future, you will need more money (you'll be retired or w/e.). Vanguard will then take that money and invest it so that in the future it'll be the same (or hopefully more) amount of money. There are a ton of other examples of how Wall Street moves money from the people who have it to the people who need it. 2) Risk - Let's say you're McDonalds. You make burgers that ppl like to buy. But, as a part of your business model, you want to charge a constant price for these burgers. You want to always charge $5 for a big mac. But, the price of wheat/beef/lettuce/whatever ISN'T constant. If there's some disease that kills a bunch of cows, then the price of beef will go up. How do you, as McDonalds, still provide a constant price to your customers? Well, you'll go over to your friends on Wall Street, and try to arrange a deal, where you can acquire beef/lettuce/whatever at a price that you set now. In that sense, you can eliminate the risk of the price going up and you can charge your customers a constant price for your products. On the other side, let's say you're an expert on lettuce farming techniques, and you're sure that the price of lettuce is about to crash. You have info on a new GMO that will make lettuce a lot easier to produce. To exploit this knowledge, you'll take on the risk that McDonalds previously had by selling them lettuce at a set price for future delivery. If all goes well, the price of lettuce will go down and you will be able to buy lettuce for cheap, and then give it to McDonalds at the higher price you set today. Wall Street facilitates these transactions. This is a small example of how Wall Street can help transfer risk from people who don't want risk to speculators. This is a pretty short summary of what Wall Street does. There are a ton of other services that Wall Street provides to the public. If someone says Wall Street doesn't do anything important, then they really don't know what Wall Street does. Wall Street provides an essential service to the public. But yeah, obviously they do get greedy and stupid sometimes.\",\n",
       "    \"Oooh I can finally answer a question! A lot of the answers here are riddled with misinformation. The answer to your question is people on Wall Street do a ton of different things. Investment Banking: this department is essentially corporate finance advisory. There are a few different areas of IB, the most well known area of ibanking is mergers and acquisitions, investment bankers advise companies on buying and merging with other companies. When you hear about Facebook buying WhatsApp, or mega mergers, investment banks were behind the scenes trying to help the deal go through. There are also other areas of banking like restructuring, equity capital markets (releasing stock to raise capital), debt capital markets (issuing bonds and debt to raise capital). Research/Sales/Trading: this is the part of investment banks that buy, sell, trade, and release research reports. They trade investor money and try to make money essentially any way they can. Some people trade derivatives, others mortgage backed securities, and many other products. Then there are other areas of finance like asset management which can range from helping people manage personal savings to helping manage pension funds etc. Do they create things? Kind of. Wall Street enables a hundred different industries by providing debt and helping to raise capital. The asset management side of things help ensure that pension funds don't run insolvent to ensure that senior citizens have cash that they have rightly earned over their careers. Obviously, there have been many unethical actions taken by financial institutions over the years, but historically have created far more wealth and value than they have destroyed. It is incredibly difficult to get hired. The majority of front office functions of banks (functions that are revenue generating) are held by Ivy League graduates with top gpas. Many front office positions require a ton of hours and are incredibly high stress. Source: have worked a variety of different positions at a variety of banks.\",\n",

       "    'At the broadest level, the financial system takes money from people who aren\\'t spending it (savers/investors/lenders) and channels it to people who need it (borrowers), either to smooth out their income or to make productive investments. There are two main ways to do this: institutions and markets. Commercial banks are institutions that take money from savers (deposits, CDs etc) and lend it to borrowers. The US (for historical and regulatory reasons) has thousands of commercial banks, spread throughout the country. Some of the biggest ones (like JP Morgan or Citi) are based in NY, others (like Wells Fargo or Bank of America) are not. The other channel is markets. Companies issue stocks (which are risky but offer upside because they pay a share of the profits) and bonds (which offer a guaranteed return, hence safer (but not completely safe because the company could always go bust) but less upside) to investors. Other entities - especially governments - also issue bonds. Fund managers (such as Vanguard or Fidelity) put these stocks and bonds together into funds that are diversified, hence less risky, and sell them to investors. Some funds (hedge funds) take on additional risk (but, in principle, better return) by borrowing money rather than just selling shares to investors. The main stock and bond markets in the US are based in NY, but the fund managers are headquartered all over the country. Investment banks (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) do many things, but historically have two functions: banking and trading. The banking side helps big companies issue stocks and bonds. They gauge the market demand, set appropriate prices, find big investors to take up the securities, manage the logistical aspects. Related to this, when there\\'s a merger or takeover, investment banks provide advice and help arrange the financing. On the trading side, investment banks have proprietary \"desks\" that specialize in buying and selling stocks, bonds and other kinds of securities. Partly this helps them understand the markets so they can do better at banking and advisory, but also (some would argue mainly) it\\'s a way to make money. Most investment banks are based in NY, so they can be \"close\" to the markets (there are some smaller regional ones). The Depression-era Glass-Steagall Law put tough limits on what commercial and investment banks could do, and mandated that these institutional types be separate (in other countries, esp in Europe, \"universal banks\" have historically done both commercial and investment banking). Glass Steagall was gradually worn down over the years, until the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of the late 1990s essentially allowed commercial and investment banks to do pretty much anything the other could do. They were still regulated by separate bodies, however, with the commercial banks under a still relatively strict regime run by the Fed and the Comptroller of the Currency (for larger banks) and the FDIC and state regulators (for smaller ones). The investment banks were under a \"light touch\" regime run by the SEC, which focused on making sure markets ran smoothly. Since the 2007-09 financial crisis and the Dodd Frank Act, the remaining big investment banks converted themselves into Bank Holding Companies (hence under the Fed for regulation) and have been supervised much more closely. Do they create anything? Well, they help allocate money more efficiently. That sounds pretty weak, but in a $17 trillion economy it can actually be pretty important. As we learned in 2008, when it goes wrong it can have some big consequences. There is research saying the financial system is probably bigger than it needs to be - and after a point, a larger financial system does not seem to help countries much in terms of growth. But that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s worthless either.',\n",

In reality, due to unrestrained greed, regulatory capture, etc., and with the help of Sen Schumer Wall Street makes money by cheating, scamming, high frequency trading, and the such. Goldman is the top bank of Wall Street, and in the word of Matt Taibi, \"the world\\'s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\" Edit: typo, accurate quotation',\n",

This is basically why people hire brokers, because it's time consuming to do this reseach yourself. And the of course there is the shady side of it, collusion, insider trading, pump and dump.

And here are the answers to your questions. Do they create anything? Yes. They create liquidity and opportunities for both parties in my definition above to make money. They provide services for both parties so those parties can provide tangible products and services to you, the consumer. Are they just playing with people\\'s money? No. No one would trust their hard earned (or easily earned) money with someone who just fucks around. People want a return on their investment not someone to \"play\" with their money. Does it serve any purpose to society? Yes. The roads you drive on, the buildings you live in are all built by money that is facilitated from wall street. The products and services that are provided to you (iphones, toaster ovens, etc.) have all come from the help of wall street (loans and stock/bond offerings).

       "    \"Wall Street's intended function is the optimal allocation of resources. With many investors choosing where to put their money, the theory is that this will result in the most worthwhile and beneficial projects receiving the most capital. The incentive is pretty simple. If you direct your capital to a project you believe in (by buying a share of stock), you can later sell it for more money, once that enterprise has used your money to become successful. Or you can keep it and be entitled to a portion of the enterprise's proceeds (dividends). And for the most part, it works. The tricky part is that it leverages greed. And greed has a way of gaming it the system. The players can become less interested in the worthy allocation of capital and more interested in making a quick buck. That is why we regulate trading pretty heavily (and some would say not heavily enough).\",\n",

       "    'Wall Street is a massive term for banks on and around Manhattan in NYC. Hell, even banks and funds in NJ gets lumped with Wall Street, sometimes as far as Greenwich, CT. So for argument, let\\'s define Wall Street as most serious financial institutions in the proximity of Manhattan. These institutions can vary very much in size. From the smallest one man funds, to large investment banks with thousands of employees. The various companies focus on different things: Some only deal in certain markets and niches, while others have many different divisions that tackle these. **Investment Banks (IB)** = In general, they underwrite. That is, they raise capital for their clients (companies) from potential investors. But they also do many, many other things. Regular credit/commercial banks can\\'t do this, because of the laws. So when you go to Bank of America (or whatever), it\\'s not the same branch of the bank that deals with IB stuff. **Mergers and Acquisitions (MA)** = When two companies want to merge, or one wants to acquire another, they contact banks to help them structure the process. **Private Equity (PE)** = PE groups, or funds, strictly deal with private capital, and private companies. Large PE groups own private companies. If you go to a Investment Bank, and say that you want to sell your company to the best bidder, they usually get in touch with PE groups in larger banks, or smaller PE firms. **Real Estate (RE)** = Same as PE, but they own assets that are tied up to Real Estate. Want to start a fund that invests in the rising real estate prices? You contact the RE groups. **Private Wealth Management (PWM)** = The group and managers that handles the wealth/portfolio of private individuals. **Hedge Funds (HF)** = Investment funds that minimize/offset risk by hedging. Basically, if you forecast that one investment is going to rise by a rate of two, and also forecast that another investment is going to sink by one (maybe it\\'s even tied up to investment one, in one way or another), you invest in both. In the end, you should end up with a net sum of positive one. This is a safety measure. Hedge funds have been extremely popular for the 20 last years, and you\\'ve seen all sorts of \"exotic\" types. **Venture Capital** = These funds and groups raise money for promising and new companies, i.e Startups. This is by nature very risky, but the reward can be huge. And the list goes on. So the banks either raise capital, advise, or invest on their own behalf, or on clients behalf. Clients can be individuals, trust funds, funds, global funds, companies, and what not. How do they affect you? In many ways. Look at these examples As a inventor / entrepreneur: You come up with a great idea, but don\\'t have enough money to develop it. What do you do? One option is to contact **Venture Capitalists**. You meet up with them, pitch your idea, and they love it. They offer to back up your startup, for a share of the company. No growth = no success, so you agree. Maybe they get 70% of the company, and you / early members get the 30%. Your startup turns out to be wildly successful, and 5-10 years down the road, you and the VC\\'s agree that it\\'s time to let in other investors. That is, you turn your company to a publicly traded company. Well how does one do that? You contact the **Investment Banks**! Or maybe a smaller firm that focuses on the whole process. In the end, you settle for a couple of different groups, from different banks. Banks like Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs. Either way, your company is now being traded. Everyone can buy shares, and own a bit of your company. You decide to retire, and sell all your shares. Maybe you net a nice billion or two. What happens next? A) For your part, you can spend the money as you like. Maybe you want to invest them on your own, or maybe you contact a PWM manager to do that for you. B) For the companies part: Maybe some PE group now owns them, or a huge chunk of the company. Sometime down the road, maybe a competitor offers a Merger. Who knows. Either way, all these banks and firms have been part of the deals. Sorry for the long write-up, as it\\'s a huge, huge topic. But the real **TL;DR ELI5** would be: Wall Street banks raise capital/underwrite, offer advisory to clients, invest money or their own, or their clients behalf. Everything that is related to Finance, they do. There\\'s no monstrous catch-all bank that excels at absolutely everything...different firms on wall street are good at different things. You find these banks in, and in the areas around: Wall Street (NYC), City (of London), Frankfurt, Singapore, etc.',\n",
       "    'Assuming you don\\'t just mean stock markets, but generally the financial industry on wall street. Some people are brokers, like middleman finding two people who want to have a transaction. Imagine you have a trainload of corn to sell - you need to sell that to someone who wants a trainload of corn. Instead of calling all of your friends, you call up a Wall Street broker, who can put this corn up for sale, helping find a buisness who wants all that corn. Other people are investors. Maybe they take the corn, and hold onto it for a few days, and when the price of corn goes up, they sell it. They can also invest another way, by \"borrowing\" someone\\'s corn at the current market rate, selling it now, and waiting for the price to go down before buying the corn back to return to the original owner. Still others are bankers, holding on to money for lots of people, and in turn lending some portion of that money out for others. The people giving their money to the bank get more money back (because people who were lent money must pay interest back), and the bankers make some money on those loans. People getting loans get money they need \"right now\" with the expectation that they can \"pay it back later.\" But what really makes wall street tick is not each of these individual transactions, but rather these transactions in all together. For every transaction that makes money, there\\'s transactions that lose money. Thus, the banker holding on to people\\'s money and lending it out, might lend it out to people who don\\'t pay him back. Or maybe the price of corn goes down after you bought it and now you have to sell it at a loss, because what are you gonna do with all that corn? Wall Street has enough outlets like this such that wall street businesses can protect these \"bets\" by placing opposite bets - maybe you buy the corn, but then protect that by also betting at worse odds that the market for corn will go down. You can spread these buying and selling across different places, so that maybe you protect your corn by buying gold, or putting money in a bank. Similarly, anything can essentially be sold. Those loans that were offered by that bank? Well, those people are going to be paying interest over time. Maybe the bank would rather sell off those loans now to someone else who wants to get those interest payments. Maybe there\\'s four house loans together that cost the bank $1million to loan out, but over 30 years the bank gets $1.3 million back (the loan plus interest). The bank could sell that to someone else for $1.1 million, thus making back their money, but now not risking those people forgetting to make their payments over 30 years. The person buying those loans takes the risk that those loans might go bad, for $0.2million gain. These sort of transactions help sellers with things, sell them when they want to, for a \"fair\" rate. It also helps buyers who want things find the things they want. In the middle, people make money off of the transactions. Some people don\\'t like the fact that the middle man makes money. You can imagine wall street like a fancy Walmart. Walmart doesn\\'t \"make\" those nike shoes, panasonic tvs, or lays potato chips, they buy them for less than they sell them for. What do you the consumer get? You get access to those goods in the same place, for a low price, because Walmart is able to negotiate the purchase of millions of units. Without Walmart in the middle, you\\'d have to find a way to get distributor-level access to all of those products, or go through a specialty shop, which would mark up the goods even more. That\\'s not to say middlemen are always good, but perhaps a necessary evil that must be somewhat limited with a few strict rules.',\n",

Then, *lots* of interesting things happen because what people are willing to pay for those stocks and bonds can change over time.

       "    \"I'm going to give a very high level explanation to your question. I feel like Wall Street gets demonized and while undoubtedly Wall Street did a ton of bad things, it serves a vital place in Society. Like many others have said, the average Wall Street employee isn't a Gordon Gekko, but someone who makes a good living in exchange for working insane hours and having little job security. Disclaimer: I work at an investment bank. I am not a fiduciary. This is my opinion only and other people might disagree. This is only a broad overview and doesn't touch upon all the relevant risks. This is not investment or tax advice, or an offer to buy or sell anything. Talk to your attorney and financial advisor and do your own due diligence. Investing has risks and you could lose money. Don't sue me. At it's core, Wall Street does two things: **1) Match people who have money with people who need money:** People with money (investors) give money to companies in need of money to grow their businesses and in return, the investors receive an IOU (debt) or part ownership in the company (stock). This is important to Society for several reasons: 1) It's a fair way to give money to the most deserving companies. Since an investor can lose money if they give money to the wrong company, an investor is incentivized to do their homework and give money only to the best companies. 2) This is a way for companies to undertake longer term projects. It's very hard for a company to grow solely through reinvesting their own money. For example, it's very hard for you to come up with enough money to buy your own house outright. Most people borrow a majority of the money to buy a house from a bank and pay the money back over time. Companies undertake investments in things like factories that are expensive upfront, but may be profitable in the long run. **2) Match people who want to take risk with people who do not want to take risk:** Let's say you are a farmer who grows corn. The price of corn today is $1, but you won't be able to harvest your corn now since its still in the ground. You are worried about the price of corn going down in 6 months, at harvest time. On the other hand, you have cereal companies that need corn to make cereal. These companies are worried about the price of corn going up in 6 months, since that would cause the price of their cereal to go up. Wall Street matches these people up, such that they can agree on a price today for the corn that will get harvested and delivered in 6 months. In this case, both parties are happy since the farmer is guaranteed a price to sell their corn (ie. no risk that the price of corn goes down) and the cereal company is happy since they're guaranteed a price to buy their corn (ie. no risk that the price of corn goes up). This is important to Society because it lets people have certainty about prices, so they can plan around them. A farmer might decide that since he or she is guaranteed a price for their corn, they can go out and buy a tractor, which will help double the amount of corn they can produce. If the farmer didn't have certainty about the price of corn, they might not want to go out and buy a tractor since the price of corn might go down and it and they might not bring in enough money to pay for the tractor. Wall Street gets into problems when: 1) They don't do enough homework and lend too much money to bad companies that can't pay the money back. 2) They take too much risk. Often times, there aren't two people with opposite risks like the farmer and the cereal company. When this happens, the farmer will enter into an agreement with a Wall Street firm. If a Wall Street firm enters into too many of these agreements and the price of corn goes down, the Wall Street firm loses a lot of money. If they lose enough money, then they might go bankrupt and might be unable to honor existing agreements.\",\n",

Essentially the value of everything is different everywhere, a programmer in new york gets paid differently from one in frankfurt, dublin, mumbai etc. This is even for food, like meat, fish to oil and even sand... basically everything. To help elaborate a bit more i need a historical example. Traders in europe in the past used to travel all the way to India in the hope of buying spices at say 10$ a ton. They were based in europe and they knew for a fact they could sell a ton of spices for 25$ because it was harder to make spices in europe. So they would buy it at 10$ and sell for 25$ and make a nice 15$ profit. Some of the guys on wall street do this, theyre traders, they buy and sell platinum and ensure that the price of platinum for example is roughly equal around the world. This makes it easier for everyone to buy say platinum as there is (generally speaking) a single agreed upon price which makes it easier for everyone to do business. Now prices arent the same on a daily or even monthly basis. For example, sunblock will cost more in summer than in winter because more people use it. Another example is roses on valentines day or fireworks over new years. This can be called short term investing or trading depends on how you view things. You buy lots of sunblock when its cheap in winter and sell in summer. A problem that can happen here is, say now the economy was hit, lots of people lose their jobs and no one goes out in summer and you dont sell any sunblock. Or alternatively everyone does really well and you run out on sunblock. Obviously it would help if you knew in advance how much sunblock to buy, the guys that do this are called analysts they try to predict the future price of goods and services so that traders and investors can know whether to buy or sell something right now or hold onto it. (This is where the value of information comes in, if you know something sooner than everyone else you can make a lot or prevent yourself from losing a lot, imagine you knew about the 08 crisis on the day before, or even just one hour ahead of everyone else). Lastly you get investors, now you get lots of types of investors. In general though these guys take money that belongs to other people and try to grow it for them. In exchange they take a portion of the growth or the whole, it really depends on how they operate their business. As a broad breakdown some of these guys buy goods and services, others buy companies (you get lots of different types of companies from a financial point of view), others even buy bonds (debt essentially) or even buy risk (insurance).',\n",

Hard to say without talking about the specific kind of engineer - so here are a few examples: For the US folks: when you take out a mortgage for your new home, the bank pays the seller. The bank can only pay for so many of such homes if they only used the money they had with them. They need to get other people(or institutions) to pitch in with their money. To do that , they let them own the loan payments you make in return for cash (and keep a portion of it). This is done by packaging loans like yours into \"products\" (a bunch of legal documents) that let others buy them. Now if you think about it, this requires experts who can create \"products\" like these, experts who know how to price these(the prices can change often for all sorts of reasons) , people to sell these (and resell), buyers who want to achieve something ( for example a Japanese institution that figures its a better deal to buy this than a treasury bond) and so on. All these things are pretty different skills of people in Wall St. Apart from that there are a bunch of support personnel, IT folks etc to ensure everything works. In this example, we got the ability to have a vibrant market letting people buy homes and get home loans ( downside being the effects of the crisis were all over the world) This packaging of \"products \" happens for a lot of other cases as well.

       "    'I work on Wall Street; excited when I saw your question (thanks for asking it). Companies exist to make money for shareholders. Companies make money by selling services and/or goods. They do this with assets (factories, intellectual property, etc.). Assets cost money, and this money can come from the initial investors of the start-up (in the form of equity, by which the equity investors are shareholders and are entitled to profits of the business), from debt (like from commercial banks, e.g. \\'loans\\' and \\'bonds\\' as they\\'re called), or secondary equity (selling equity of the company to private investors or the public, who also become shareholders). Repeat: companies must finance assets with capital in the form of equity and debt in order to make money. Investment banks (for which Wall Street is a colloquialism) are middlemen for \"capital markets\". They connect companies with investors who can invest capital (debt or equity). Investors include large pension fund managers, university endowments, hedge funds managing private wealth, and asset managers of corporate funds, who invest in IPOs and bond issues that the investment banks organize. Investors invest in company capital in order to receive a return on investment; they want to grow the wealth that they hold. For debt capital, investors receive interest. For equity, investors receive profits (free cash flow) in the form of dividend payments, share price appreciation from the business becoming more valuable over time, and stock buybacks. Investment banks do other things like M & A advisory (which is what I do; one company or investor purchasing capital in the form of an entire company\\'s equity and debt (capital structure)) and sales and trading (providing securities trading services to investors). IN SUMMARY: companies need money to grow their business and investors want to invest in enterprises that can yield a return on investment.

Now imagine you threw that tiny little shell full of goop at the wall. Even if you threw it as hard as you could, it's still soooo tiny and soooo tough and bouncy on the outside that it'll just bounce off. Flies are super tiny, and have a shell just like that ping pong ball, but with little flexible, foldable wings. And just like a fly, if you use a slingshot instead of your hand (a moving car instead of a window) you might just get it to pop. **Edit for a bit more actual explanation:** Flies have an exoskeleton that's incredibly tough and hard in some spots, and just flexible enough to be springy and bouncy in others. Just like that ping pong ball, they've got a shell that's good at taking a bit of a hit and bouncing off instead of just squishing like a worm (which doesn't have that tough shell). The fact that they're so small helps in a couple different ways as well. For one, we *think* they're flying super fast, but it's really just because they're tiny. If you look at a massive airplane, it might be moving at 500 miles per hour but still looks like it's just crawling along across the sky. Houseflies look fast, but [I asked Google]( URL_0 ) and they only go about 5 miles per hour. That means a baseball pitcher can throw a fastball **20 times as fast as a housefly flies**. Not only are they actually super slow (if you don't let the size trick you), they also weigh almost nothing. Like, it would take about 200 flies to add up to the weight of a single ping pong ball, according to some quick Googling/converting. So your ping pong ball full of cool whip is actually super tough, reaaally slow, and unbelievably lightweight, meaning that dumb little fly was *designed* to fly into the window several thousand times before it finds the opening. Evolution at work.\",\n",

The idea is that strength is mostly determined by the cross sectional area of whatever it is you are measuring, which increases with the square of the dimensions. The weight usually increases with the cube of the dimension. So if you have a rectangular bar and double its size its strength will increase four times, but it's weight will increase by eight times making it half as strong for its weight.

       "    \"The short and sweet answer is that they have such a small mass and move so slowly. Let's say you have an average housefly named Luke Flywalker. Luke has a mass of 12mg (0.000012kg) and has a max flying speed of 5mph (2.235 m/s). You find him resting on a delicious plate of mac  &  cheese that you want to eat so you swat him. Scared for his tiny life, he instantly engages his tiny thrusters to make the jump to flyperspace and starts flying away as fast as he can, reaching max speed after flying for 1 full second. Let's also say that the idea of being smushed has brought back haunting trash compactor memories (from a sleep-over at his dad's house a long time ago) so terrifying that he doesn't pay attention to where he's going and flies right into a glass window as soon as he hits max speed. This gives the fly an acceleration of 2.235 (m/s)/s at the time of impact. Now, the Force (hehe) equals mass multiplied by acceleration (F=ma). So if this young Jedfly reached his max speed at the instant of impact, he would still only strike it with a Force of 0.00002682 Newtons (0.000012kg x 2.235m/s^2). So since 1 lbf (pound-force) is equal to 4.48 Newtons, Luke Flywalker flying at max speed into a window only puts 0.00000603 lbs of force in his body and he is free to eat your food another day.

       "    \"Now, we need to talk first about volume/surface ratio. All living beings are made from the same things pretty much, so more volume generally means more weight (unless you adopt measures to reduce weight such hollow bones in birds). Think about a cube: if i take a 3 meters cube, the face has a surface of 9 square meters (3^2), while the volume would be of 27 cubic meters (3^3). Now this means that if you increase the size of an animal, volume (and hence weight) gets exponentially higher than surface. Now we have to introduce the concept of pressure, pressure is weight divided by surface. The higher the weight, the higher the pressure, but the higher the surface, the lower the pressure is. Now you can understand my point: bigger animals have a higher weight in proportion to the surface that impacts an object or the ground. Now, all living beings are made of the same thing, cells, so cells of the outer layer are what absorb an impact with something. If a fly flies into a wall, the cells on his outer layer that face the wall absorb the impact and aren't damaged. If an elephant impacts a wall at the same speed, the cells on his outer layer are still of the same size and have similar properties than the ones of a fly, but the pressure applied to them is way stronger due to the elephant having a higher weight/surface proportion, due to being bigger, so the cells get destroyed by the impact. Living being have evolved ways to get bigger, we have a sturdy core (bones), a system of pretty resistant wires (tendons and muscles) and an outer layer of cells that are constantly changed and can die without much consequences up to a certain point (skin) plus many other things, but this can go only up to a certain point, animals like the Blue Whale couldn't exist on the land cause their own weight would crush them. Think it like this: throw a small ball of hollow bricks from 1 meter, most likely all the bricks will be intact. Throw a big ball of bricks from 1 meter and most likely the lower bricks will broke. Ammass a large enough ball of bricks and the bricks at the bottom will crush under the weight without needing a 1 meter drop. You can solve this by using an organized brick structure, iron bars, concrete and stuff, basically sturdier materials and better organization, but there is a limit to how big of a building you can make.

The fly hitting a wall is not so much like a human being falling through air and landing on a hard surface. It is more similar to a human being jumping into a few meters of water and hitting the bottom.',\n",

Googled this once and read an example about a cockroach falling down a mineshaft is fine, a mouse is stunned, a human breaks their legs, a horse... no longer resembles a horse. Also a big part is mass, a bowling ball at high velocity is harder to stop than am average hollow ping pong ball. Now if the object hits an object of similar or stronger material, the object in motion will have a lot of stress on impact. The front of the fly is hitting the object and and has a low enough mass to quickly decelerate without the rest of its body trying to pancake itself against the object.',\n",

Also, since they are so small, our eyes perceive them as fast, but that is not true. Using worldoak's google search, the housefly moves 5 mph. If you have the mass of the fly, the force is just 2.235 * 2*10^-5 = 4.47 * 10^(-5). That is an incredibly tiny force and for a skeleton, that tough, a fly ramming into a concrete brick thousands of times would not even make the smallest of cracks.\",\n",
       "    \"from a physical point of view, it all has to do with Conservation of Momentum and Kinetic energy. both of these are effected by mass and speed. the gist of it is, its not only the high speed that has effects the collision but also the mass of the fly. because the fly is so light weight, the energy it receives when getting hit is still FAR less than what a human would receive going at the same speed. and the fly's body is capable of handling that amount of energy\",\n",
       "    \"Another of these questions like the one with the concrete wall, it's all in the force that it takes to move a 1 gram fly compared to a 70kg human, it takes muuuuuuuch less force so the fly experiences the same deceleration but it is releasing less energy and has less momentum. It takes less force for them to stop so i they don't feel anything... As someone stated they do have a protective layer but that's biology and not my speciality\",\n",

It obviously got to a lot of people. As someone who still has a fair few college and high school aged friends I have noticed a massive increase in racist and derogatory comments towards Muslims and 'foreigners'. I will not quite but the things some people are posting are actually quite scary. Anyway this is escalating. The EDL (English defence league) is staging demonstrations and marches as well as, I believe in an unrelated way, the BNP (British national party) are too. In the news today, or yesterday it has been reported of people attacking mosques and helplines for victims of racial or religion based abuse have had a massive increase in incidents. There have been claims (of which I cannot find the source again) by the EDL I believe that there is a risk of a predicted civil war between different cultures breaking out over this. My personal opinion is that the problems in the UK are all down to a lot of people getting massively confused with Muslims and extremists. There's a lot of tension, anger and very inappropriate comments being made towards people who have had nothing to do with the murder. There's always been a lot of anger towards illegal immigrants and people again very wrongly assume just because someone is of a different descent, color or otherwise that they 'shouldn't be here'. The guy who appeared on national tv covered in blood made his claims with a thick south London accent. He is I believe not only legally allowed to be here but has a British passport.

I'm sure that when Catholic Irish or Italians migrated to the US they were treated with similar hate and forced into their own insular societies, and people would claim the 'Catholic tide' was going to overwhelm Protestantism. Personally, I don't think it's anything to be too worried about. /r/worldnews really is a cesspool - don't go there for an objective opinion on Islam in Europe.\",\n",
       "    'Okay, many people seem to forget that there is also a political perspective in there. From what I can tell about Germany, immigrants are usually alienated by putting them somewhere in the outskirts and leaving them to themselves. They get little financial support but that\\'s about it. \"Integrating\" isn\\'t usually easy if you don\\'t even get the chance to visit a language course as they can\\'t pay for them themselves and the government doesn\\'t really seem to care. Once the immigrants move into their new homes they are usually surrounded with other immigrants. They know little or nothing about the life in Europe and usually stick to the people with a similar cultural background and who speak a language they can communicate in. So the Muslims \"not willing to integrate\" don\\'t even get a real chance and often Germans don\\'t even want them to integrate because they don\\'t want to have to deal with \"foreigners\" anyway. In Germany we even have something called \"Residenzpflicht\" for some immigrants which means that they are only allowed to move in a certain radius and if they leave that radius they commit a criminal offense. So even if they tried to get to know their new country they can\\'t even get outside the town they live in. So all this then leads to districts where Muslim immigrants are kept to themselves and build up their own habitat, including things like Mosques. Of course they have it harder to learn the language because they don\\'t really need to know German when they are surrounded by people who all speak Turkish or Arabic or some sort of mix between those two and German. It is basically a vicious circle for them because the conditions they have to live in are very poor and there are very few jobs and the educational system fails entirely. Getting out of those \"Ghettos\" isn\\'t easy as well because they face institutionalized racism (from police and other government agencies to landlords who won\\'t rent their apartments to immigrants) pretty much everywhere and just don\\'t get the money to get out of these conditions. That of course leads to problems like criminality, drugs, prostitution etc. And although many people have been put in those situations politics and media did a great job making THEM the scapegoats. So what you now have is major parts of Europe blaming most of the national problems on Muslims and their unwillingness to adapt to a living in Europe. And since it is a popularizing issue some political parties of course jump the bandwagon more or less successfully (in the Netherlands for example [Geert Wilders]( URL_0 ) right-wing populist party PVV). What happens now is simply immigrants being fed up with their situation, tired of being treated as second class citizens and not been given a chance that their frustration can turn into violence. People too long didn\\'t give a shit about those people\\'s problems and needs and now they wonder that the immigrants are frustrated and won\\'t adapt. Also, many people here don\\'t seem to understand that \"integration\" is a reciprocal act and not just \"them\" living how \"we\" want them to.

Whenever I go into KJ I pass the same sign (I should take a pic of it one day) and it explains that men who visit KJ should not wear shorts, tees, and that KJ maintains gender separation. Now they don't really say anything to a worker like myself because I'd just laugh at them and get back to swinging a hammer, but the point is the law is there and in their community they wholly abide by it. Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is this: for all the wackiness that KJ has going for it (can't work past 1PM on Friday, can't work there Saturday even though I'm not Jewish) it still manages to be a community that isn't destroying the fabric of the neighboring towns. Yeah, its customs are definitely foreign, its omnipresent apartments with TERRIBLE framing are ugly but life goes on. And if we're to assume the majority of Muslims are just normal people, I'd expect that to be the same too. Now I know people are going to say Sharia law is fundamentally disenfranchising women--I can't argue this because I know very little about it--but there can still be common ground when allowing these minority groups in, just as we here in NY have done.\",\n",

       "    \"Trains can be extremely heavy, this weight is focused upon the fairly small area of their wheels. The stones are actually called *track ballast* and help to spread the huge force from the train's wheels out over a larger area of ground. Without this ballast the ground underneath might sink unevenly. The sleepers (*cross ties*) of the tracks are not directly attached to the ballast which allows the track to have a little movement (e.g. as the track expands and contracts due to changes in temperature). Stones are a good choice for this role because: 1. They are cheap. 2. They can resist compressive loads well. 3. Relatively low maintenance. Also of note: ballast is itself built upon a foundation of earth (the *subgrade*) that helps to raise the track and further distribute load. Other functions: stops plants growing around the tracks, allows water to drain away. Are rocks a significant derailment hazard? Not really -- trains are massive and move quickly -- this enormous momentum means they smash right through most anything in their path. Rocks are typically turned to dust by the wheels of the train or thrown out of the way by the tremendous pressure of the wheels against the track.\",\n",

Now about the whole stone on the track thing. Trains don't give a single fuck about pretty much anything on the tracks. Stones are reduced to dust. Coins are reminted.

It is basically track fixed directly to reinforced concrete slabs and has the advantage of increased stability and lower maintenance costs. It is however expensive, so sleepers and ballast are used instead.

       "    \"These stones are called ballast, and their job is to provide a sort of 'bed' or base for the track to sit on top of (hence why it's sometimes called the 'trackbed'). Basically, it allows water to drain through, and the stones can shift slightly to evenly distribute the weight of the train into the ground as the train goes over it. If the ballast wasn't there, the weight of the trains going over, combined with a build up of water, would cause ground subsidence under the track - the track would be pushed into the dirt by the weight of the trains. On some modern rail lines they instead use concrete slab track like [this]( URL_0 ), where the rail sits on top of sprung 'chairs', which distribute the weight into the track. This system is low maintenance and allows higher speeds, but is also much more expensive to build. As for your second question, this poses absolutely no harm to the train at all. Only a very small section of the wheel is in contact with the track, and it has the entire weight of the train on top of it, so it ploughs through everything.

       "    \"The crushed stones are what is known as ballast. Their purpose is to hold the wooden cross ties in place, which in turn hold the rails in place. You start with the bare ground, and then build up a foundation to raise the track high enough so it won't get flooded. On top of the foundation, you deposit a load of crushed stone (the ballast). On top of the stone, you lay down (perpendicular to the direction of the track) a line of wooden beams on 19.5 inch centers, 8 1/2 feet long, 9 inches wide and 7 inches thick, weighing about 200 pounds...3,249 of them per mile. You then continue to dump crushed stone all around the beams. The sharp edges of the stone make it difficult for them to slide over each other (in the way that smooth, round pebbles would), thus effectively locking them in place. This is all necessary because a train (depending on size) moving across the tracks can exert up to 1,000,000 pounds of moving pressure on the tracks\",\n",
       "    'Stones in this case are called **ballast**. They ensure the properly drainage of the laying terrain, and, also, serves as a blocking device for the sleepers and as a weight-distribution over the soil. Imagine if you lay the rails and sleepers right over the terrain, without laying the geotextile and the ballast bed: if the soil contains clays, the rain will not drain properly, thus creating an unstable condition (twisted rails, misalignments, deflections). The ballast helps to maintain the soil properly drained (keeping in mind that, below the crushed rocks, there is a geotextile). Also, it bears the loads on the sleepers (or ties), distributing the weight uniformly on the terrain. And, of course, holds the ties and rails in place.',\n",

This is a much bigger risk to derailment than a stone on the track.

The elevation of the trapezoid also stops water run off/small amounts of flooding moving/washing the tracks away. The reason stones are an ideal ballast material is more complicated, the simple explanation being that stones are a granular material that allows water to drain through the ballast area. Because water is not retained the ballast will not have a long term settlement (sink further over time) so the tracks stay in the same place in the long term. Source: Civil Engineer.',\n",

It's a pretty neat deal that's all controlled by satellite. Sometimes, however, a lot of stray rocks will stay on the rails after a ballast train has dropped its load. Being the first train to hit rails covered with ballast is always a fun/uncomfortable experience. You feel every. Single. Rock.

It moves at about 1 MPH and consists of two, separate hydraulically powered rotary brooms which sweep a width of 9 feet or so, which completely cleans finished track during a single pass. An undercutter is use for re-ballasting road crossings, improving track conditions, roadbed prep, etc. It moves about 600 ft per hour. It can trench depths up to 34 inches below the top of the rail. A ballast compactor restores the bed, ballast, and track geometry. Moves at about 2-4 miles per hour. A ballast regulator moves at about 3-5 miles per hour, and transfers ballast from the field side of one rail to the field side of another, and the same for the gauge side of the rail. The shoulder ballast cleaner - picks up the ballast off the end of the ties and moves the ballast and mud into a shaker box that separates the two. The dirt is moved to the side of the track, and the cleaned ballast is dumped back onto the shoulder. A track geometry car identifies and records track defects and can travel any of the speeds posted in a specific division. It identifies defects by mechanically measuring track parameters while under heavy loads. The measurements are recorded electronically and compares them to normal track standards.

For losing fat, I have this philosophy: When you are exercising to lose weight, your goal is to *lose weight*. But realise that weight doesn't equal fat. You are made of much more than just fat. During exercise your body first uses any available energy source directly from your bloodstream, but once that's depleted, your body starts utilizing energy storages. Energy is stored in as well muscle as in fat. So your body is going to break down fat tissue *and* glycogen from your muscles at the same time. After this, you eat to restore energy. But don't overdo it, because then the workout would be for naught! Avoid saturated fatty acids and go for complex carbohydrates and proteins (to restore muscle fibers and your glycogen). This way fat will barely not be restored. Now, when you come to the low body fat percentages, another part comes to play. Fat is not just ugly, it does serve a purpose. Fat keeps you warm in the winter and provides kind of like a protective layer. Your body just genetically doesn't want to lose his nice and warm soft layer so it will *actively* store fat. Even if you only ate proteins, your body can metabolize proteins to sugar and than sugars to fat. So moral of the story; exercise is important, but **DIET IS EVERYTHING!**\",\n",
       "    \"Diminishing returns. The more you do something, the less of an effect you're gonna receive out of it. When initially gaining muscle, your body is doing something it isn't used to and you have a lot more room to grow. Muscle fibers aren't created, they just get bigger until they can't grow any more. Fat is excess energy. So when you're obese, you have lots of energy that your body didn't initially need but is willing to give up. You do need fat to survive and your body does want to keep some of it.\",\n",

       "    'Alright, sit yo ass down and get ready for a story. The TLDR is indeed ratings and production cost. But if that\\'s the why, we must ask ourselves \"why now?\" What happened to these stations, and why did it all happen at the same time? Well, the seed of change (or pestilence if you wanna be poetic) is TLC. Before The Channel Formally known as Learning gave us child beauty pageants and whatever the fuck Honey Boo Boo is supposed to be. You see, in 2007 Discovery was kind of in a hole. As you may know Discovery owns, TLC, Nat Geo, Animal Planet and more. Despite their wide net, the brand was tanking. So they brought in a man from NBC (who would soon sell out to Comcast) to liven things up. The Discovery Channel store was closed, the main station started doing documentaries more fit for history channel with \"True crime\" exploitation pieces. This would in turn hemorrhage viewership from History (A sister network of A & E) who began showing programs like Gangland. Modern Marvels (which had existed since 1995) got a shiny update, and the content of the History Channel become the closest content rival for Discovery. But then, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, or more accurately here comes TLC\\'s shit shows. Ya see, part of the way Discovery was able to have so many networks was appealing to different demos for each one. History had been nailing the males over 40 crowd and discovery had been shooting for educated younger males. TLC was basically discovery channel marketed to women in their early 20s to early 30s, and you know what bored women of that age-range were watching? Soaps, MTV/VH1 reality shows and celebrity gossip. Taking a \"documentary\" series about child fashion shows and editing it like an MTV reality show with a healthy bit of exploitation (the fans of these shows are watching to laugh at these people, make no mistake) and they suddenly had a the right ingredients for what would become a network of cheep, exploitative, schlock across all Discovery Networks (well, except the Science Channel). So What really happened? What really changed? Demographics. Say what you will about these networks being crap, they do a good job of not internally fighting with each other for attention. The Honey Boo Boo crowd doesn\\'t want much to do with \"are Megladon\\'s still around\" the age range, income level, and general education of the demo they\\'re trying to reach can be reliably expected to enjoy the TV click bait. They figured out something Buzzfeed did before you wanted to inexplicably punch it in the face: people don\\'t want to learn, they want to have what they know and like confirmed. This is how Discovery Channels\\' most profitable stretch, year after year, is telling people sharks aren\\'t violent murder machines (except when they are but it\\'s okay because not to people) like it\\'s the first time anybody has heard this information. Apologies to Shark Week fans, but how surreal is it that the most educational thing on the network is telling a demographic that didn\\'t grow up with Jaws shit they already know from last year? And then there\\'s history channel. History is, again, owned by A & E not discovery. History is a tougher nut to dissect. In short, as they became more direct competition for Discovery they began duplicating what was making discovery successful. Deadliest Catch became Ice Road Truckers, bad speculative science docs became Ancient Aliens. History duplicated the pacing of TLC and marketed it to men, but dumbed its content down to turn the stuff with potential to be good into a filter for Discovery Channel\\'s scraps. A & E went the way of TLC and now theirs no real market incentive to change. If you really want to know whose to blame, look in the mirror. The original demographics have moved on. We\\'re watching Netflix and are simply too educated to watch a show about convergent mermaid evolution. Discovery says they\\'re gonna start making quality programming again, so demand might be returning as Millennials get more disposable income (Oh right, the other big reason! Because of the whole recession thing, cheaper shows became a must and Gen-Xers aged 34-48 had more money than the groups they were, on paper, marketing towards so include this disclaimer in the paragraph about TLC\\'s market shift) and educated young people starting families in their late 20s is presenting itself as a important demographic to snag. In short: The Economy tanked around the same time as the networks underwent massive internal restructuring. Networks that were in mild competition with each other entered a full race to the bottom and neither one went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.',\n",

The reason why the advertisements say, 'Ask your doctor about a certain prescription' is so you can go to your doctor and ask for their prescription vs. the competition.

       "    'Now here’s something I can answer! Germany’s export surplus comes from the fact that the German Euro is Undervalued. In classical economics, a trade surplus will always inevitably lead to the currency becoming more expensive, decreasing exports and solving the trade surplus. The problem is that Germany does not have its own currency but uses the Euro, so the normal mechanism which causes currencies to rise in price does not work. We are stuck in a position where the German Euro is too Low and the Greek Euro is too high, although they are worth the same. Is this a problem for the global economy? Yes, because German goods are artificially cheap and greek goods are artificially expensive. This continuously drains wealth from the other eurozone nations into Germany. Is it a US problem? Well yes, but slapping tariffs doesn’t accomplish much. German manufacturers can just ship their stuff to France and then the US and avoid the country specific tariff. If the US places a tariff against the entire EU, then things could get really ugly. The best option is not to cut off foreign goods for being “unfair”, but to actually develop your industries. If you cannot compete in a certain area (eg textiles vs Indonesia or Vietnam) you move on to another industry. Nothing lasts forever and protectionism will just destroy you when the walls eventually come down.',\n",
       "    'Germany is to the EU what China is to the US. Which is to say that it has a much lower cost of manufacturing for just about everything, and so due to the EU\\'s common market/Germany\\'s close proximity to other EU countries Germany has just come to dominate industrial production in the EU. The overwhelming majority of what Germany exports to the US are cars and industrial engines, as well as parts for both of those. The trade deficit that Germany is running with the US isn\\'t because its exporting a lot to the US, but rather because it imports very little. Over time running a trade deficit drains wealth out of an economy, making a country poorer over time. Every dollar of a country\\'s trade deficit needs to either come from its citizen\\'s savings, or be financed through foreign debt. In the first case, the country immediately becomes poorer. In the latter case the country becomes poorer in the future, though how much poorer depends on the interest rate of the loans and how much inflation has occurred in the meantime. It is possible to outgrow a trade deficit. For example, the US has run a trade deficit since the 80\\'s and nonetheless has had relatively robust growth since that time. Although the US trade deficit is draining wealth out of the country, the US\\' position as the main driver of innovation in the world causes it to generate enough new wealth every year to replace what is leaving through the trade deficit and grow the economy. Since 2008, every Western European country has seen negative real GDP growth (that is, their GDP growth is either equal to or less than inflation+population growth). Although this is a complex situation, the underlying cause can basically be boiled down to Germany running a large trade surplus with Western Europe while being unable to convert that trade surplus into GDP growth due to a lack of consumer spending. Basically, Germany has become stuck in a cycle wherein other EU countries buy German goods, and then Germany takes the money from those purchases and loans it back so that those countries can continue to afford to buy more German goods next year. You can see the situation in Greece circa 2010 as being the end result of that cycle when the importing country replaces its entire domestic industry with foreign goods purchased with foreign loans. That doesn\\'t mean that Italy and France will become repeats of Greece, because those countries still do have an industrial base. But Greece is a good example of how wealth is drained out of country by this system. Nor does it mean that this situation is bad for Germany. Although Germany has seen very little growth from it so far, Germany has more than tripled the amount of foreign currency in its possession since 2004 and increased its industrial base by about 75%. *At some point* German consumers will start spending that money instead of shipping it back overseas, and when that happens they will become much wealthier. As for the US, Germany is draining about $70 billion in wealth from the US economy every year. Regardless of whether the US can replace that wealth through innovation, the US\\' main complaint is that the trade deficit arises largely from informal trade barriers that Germany has erected to US goods. For example, most US goods need to go through a complex and costly certification process before they can be sold in Germany. This makes it almost impossible for most small US businesses to export goods there, as they don\\'t have the financial capacity to navigate the German bureaucracy. For large US companies, this acts as an effective tariff. The US Import/Export Banks official guidance on Germany politely sums it up as: \"While not directly discriminatory, government regulation by virtue of its complexity may offer a degree of protection to established local suppliers. Safety or environmental standards, not inherently discriminatory but sometimes zealously applied, can complicate access to the market for U.S. products. American companies interested in exporting to Germany should make sure they know which standards apply to their product and obtain timely testing and certification.\"',\n",

A song copyright has several different parts: the right to display publicly, the right to reproduce, the right to distribute, the right to perform, and the right to make derivative works.

These organization handle the payment of PERFORMANCE ROYALTIES, which come from the licenses that businesses and radio stations need to play music. Restaurant of a certain size playing music? You need to a blanket license. Radio station? You need a license. Concert venue? You need a license. A blanket license allows a venue or business to play all of the songs in BMI or ASCAP\\'s catalogs –the rate dependent on venue size, audience, etc. Now what makes this interesting is that terrestrial radio is unique from the internet in that terrestrial radio pays no performance royalties for the MASTER RECORDING of songs on the radio. When you listen to a song, the song is two copyrights: the COMPOSITION COPYRIGHT (the actual composition of the song, the melody, the lyrics) and the MASTER COPYRIGHT (the copyright for the actual recording itself. Often owned by the label). Imagine that Kesha has a song on the radio with millions of plays, but she didn\\'t write it. She will receive NO performance royalties for her song on the radio. Instead, the songwriters will receive all the terrestrial performance royalties on the radio. This is due to master recordings not actually having a copyright until around 1972. The digital space changed this loophole because digital radio is not really \"radio\" in the legal definition of the word. However, for non interactive radio streams (e.g. a online broadcast of the terrestrial broadcast), these streams can still stream songs with a performance license –they just need to pay performance license fees for the master recordings as well.

       "    'Hey kid, don\\'t ever get into fights at school, OK? What I\\'m about to explain to you is how the bigger world works, but only because there are no teachers. Since you have teachers at your school, you should go to them and they will help you. When I say \"take down the bully\" or \"lose your friends\", I mean getting in trouble so that they\\'re suspended or expelled. So, the school bullies have started being much too aggressive, so now you have created a strike force to stop them. You have 10 friends, and there are 50 bullies. Already you realize you can\\'t take all the bullies at once!! But you and your friends are smart, and can take them out one by one. Now, there are only 4 days of school left (8 if you\\'re re-elected), and you want to make the school safer for the next class. You could always just sit around and play games with your friends. Fighting the bullies would actually make you and your friends more sad, but playing games would make you happier. But you\\'ve decided, for the greater good, you\\'ll at least intervene and stop a few bullies while you\\'re there. But now, who do you stop? You can\\'t take on all the bullies at once. And you don\\'t have enough time to take them all out one by one. So you look for which bully is the worst. But perhaps even that isn\\'t the smartest way to do it. Let\\'s say we can rank the bullies as if it\\'s a class. There are A bullies, B bullies, and so on. Of course, it\\'s hard to tell whether a bully is very bad, or you are just wrong and estimated it wrong. You might take down an A bully, but it turns out they were D all along, so your time could have been better spent elsewhere. [*cough* Iraq *cough*] So you have all these bullies and their estimated ranks. It\\'s a simple matter of going after all the A bullies, then the B bullies, and so on. But wait! One of the B bullies is always taking your lunch. You actually have to go back home in the middle of the day and get some food, and then come back to school. This is taking up time [and resources] that could be spent fighting more bullies! So you decide that, even though it\\'s just a B bully, you\\'ll take him out first, since that\\'s smartest. Then you come across a really mean A bully. But he doesn\\'t bully you that much. He bullies more the other bullies, and leaves you alone most of the time. Obviously, you can come back to him later. You find a few others, with different levels of hurting you, but since they only bully you a few times a year, and are actually doing other things, you can come back to them later. Then you come to a really strong and bad A bully. He\\'s hasn\\'t bullied you guys so much, but is really bullying other little innocent kids. You should take him down. But if you take him on, you will lose 5 of your friends. Those friends can actually help you take on more bullies, so you should think about saving this bully for later, and using these friends to take down this big one after those others. But you\\'ve decided that this big bully has to be taken down even if you lose 5 of your friends. The problem is, this particular bully won\\'t be alone. While you can take others one by one, this one will get others\\' help to oppose you. In fact, every time you take down a bully, you are actually making all the bullies more likely to make a team and take you down. So even though you could take down 3 or 4 bullies a day, it might be better to only take down 1 or maybe even 0. In the meantime, you make strategies with your friends about how to take down the bullies as inconspicuously as possible, and also which are the most immediately important and which are not. You\\'re starting to realize that all your friends are listening to you. Some come to you for help since a bully is starting to bully them. Others come with ideas about which bullies to take on that would make things better for yourself and your friends only, but not the other kids. But most of the other kids also support you. You\\'ve just realized that you\\'re the one who has the best information about the bullies, and can make decisions which ones to take down first. Everyone will listen to you, since it makes more sense to do your ideas of taking down the school lunch bully first, not taking the super strong one early, and so on. But you also realize that you could easily just say to take down a bully that *isn\\'t* the best bully. Maybe one annoyed you specifically and you want to take him out. Or maybe you could take all the candy from one and you choose him over another. You could easily just pick to take down the bullies that benefits you and your friends the most, without benefiting the other kids, but saying that you\\'re picking the best, and nobody would know. So you have to be careful not to become selfish, since you have so much power. You remember Spiderman, right? With great power comes great responsibility! You\\'ll have to pick your battles, and the same is true later in life. But, I don\\'t want to hear any fighting with bullies at school, am I clear? If somebody bullies you, go to the teacher right away! **TL;DR: complex prioritization with potential for corruption**',\n",

These languages all have support for *loops*. A loop allows the programmer to make a certain behavior repeat over and over again. The programmer can put conditions on when the loop should stop (e.g., you hit the escape key, or click \"Quit\" on the menu). At the center of every game is a loop that repeats itself really fast. Each time the loop iterates, the entire game is updated. The computer will check whether you\\'ve pressed any butons or moved the mouse, and if so it will recalculate the positions of relevant objects in the game world. This might be simple, but it might also involve a vast physics simulation in the background which has a lot of brilliant tricks to take into account the fact that the physics is updated at discrete steps (every time the loop iterates), not continuously as in the real world (or so we assume... :D). As for how pictures get on the screen, the screen is *redrawn* every single frame. Every. Single. Frame. It\\'s all redrawn. (And a \"frame\" is nothing but an iteration of the loop I talked about above.) How does the programmer actually get stuff on the screen? That\\'s what DirectX and OpenGL are for. These are vast libraries of pre-written code that can communicate directly with the video card, which in turn has the capability of convincing the monitor to display stuff. How does DirectX know how to communicate with your video card? That\\'s what the video driver is for. Now, finally, what does the programmer tell the video card to draw? How in the world does he figure out how to draw a 3D scene on a 2D grid of pixels? This uses [linear algebra]( URL_0 ). But forget about the details of the math. It\\'s just a sequence of steps. Say you want to draw a cube on the screen. Now the vertices of the square exist in some arbitrary coordinate system whose origin is probably the cube\\'s center. The first step is to translate the cube to its desired location in the actual game environment. This also involves rotating the cube or scaling it. Now we know that the player is somewhere in the environment looking in some direction. The second step is to translate and rotate the entire world according to where the player is standing and where he\\'s looking. Ex: if the player strafes left, the world slides right; if the player is looking up, then world rotates down, around the point where the player\\'s eyes are at. (Simplified.) I remember playing Crusin\\' USA on N64 when I was little, and I sometimes wondered... is the car really moving, or is the ground moving while the car is stationary? The truth is much closer to the latter! The world moves around the player. (Simplified.) The final step is to project all the transformed geometry onto a plane, which represents the screen. This produces a set of polygons on the plane to be drawn, almost always triangles because video hardware is optimized for rendering triangles. These data are then send to the video card, which then gets it on the monitor. Each of these three steps is a simple mathematical computation expressible in a unified manner using linear algebra. Video hardware is exceptionally well-optimized for performing these calcluations with triangles.',\n",

If you put enough bricks and shape them, they can become something huge like a house, bridge, etc. Computer games and programs are similar, except they are made from ideas that you can\\'t touch like you can touch a brick. If you have an idea you can tell me your idea using sentences, words and letters. To a computer, the Ones are Zeros are the \"letters\" that make up the words that form the ideas which in turn make up a computer program/game.',\n",
       "    'Think of the ones and zeroes like on/off switches. In a computer the one or zero determines if a given gate is open or closed to an electronic signal. This can be likened to a mechanical calculator. As switches are flipped and the gears move they manipulate other switches in a predictable pattern. Old calculators were like this. You punched a series of buttons and then the machine whirred through one \"step\" and produced an output. If you get more fancy you take that output and feed it back in and run another step. Do it over and over and you can manage complex calculations over time. A computer does exactly the same thing except electronically instead of mechanically. Being electronic allows for massive speed increases and dramatically smaller size. Your computer also runs through one \"step\" at a time, same as a mechanical computer. This is the \"clock speed\" you see advertised for CPUs and such. Your computer runs like a metronome doing one thing per tick. It happens it can do a helluva lot of ticks in one second. So, how does this convert to a computer game? Make it simpler and consider how digital music becomes sound. The switches are manipulated according to rules as mentioned above. The final output is a digital stream. This is fed into a digital-analog-converter (DAC) which converts the input into an analog output that runs your speakers (all speakers are analog at the end of it). Given the enormous speeds and huge number of switches (billions) in a modern computer you can get them to produce elaborate results that can be converted into colors and sound and tactile or whatever you want. When you can do enough of them fast enough the results can be combined into a game. Obviously in the past when they were slower you had less elaborate results. Hope that made some sense.',\n",
       "    \"Alright, I'll take a shot at it. You're right, at the lowest level, computers manipulate all data in the form of 1's and 0's. However, any information can be translated into 1's and 0's. On the computer, a picture (and you can see this clearly when you really zoom into a digital image) is just a grid of tiny squares. Each square is assigned a color, and each color is created by mixing 256 different shades of red, green and blue (RGB). So saving any image is just a matter of writing down the RGB values for each square in the grid, each of which can vary from 0 to 255. Conversely, your computer screen is also just a grid, with a fixed resolution (E.g. 1280x1024 squares), so to display an image it just needs to figure out what color to show on each of those squares and transmit that information to the monitor. An animation, or moving image, is achieved by changing the display very quickly to fool the eye into perceiving continuous motion. Similarly a sound is just a waveform. So, to save a sound, you would have to note down the amplitude of the wave at a given point in time. If you noted this amplitude once per second, you would get a very crude approximation of the actual sound. If you increased this to many thousands of times per second, it would be very hard for a human ear to distinguish between the original wave and the digitized version. E.g. CDs sample music at a rate of 44,100 samples per second.\",\n",
       "    'You may have sort-of read it already, but I think that some people are trying to add too much detail. You read the other question about compilers already, so you kinda get how you can program in a higher level language and get that converted into the 1s and 0s. A fundamental concept that needs to be understood is that you can represent a wide variety of complex things using a combination of more simple things. Words are probably the good and obvious example. Letters, in and of themselves, are meaningless. When you combine them together, you get things (words) that are more complex and have *some* meaning. Then you combine those words together into paragraphs for more meaning, and some context, and so on until you have chapters, books and so on. To represent numbers, with ones and zeros you have to know how binary works. I\\'m not going to go into detail, but it\\'s enough to know that 0001 is the number 1, 0010 is the number 2, 0011 is the number three and 0100 is the number 4. This goes on and on. Then, at some point people decided that the numbers 65 and 97 would be the letters A and a (this is in [ASCII]( URL_0 ), which is a common encoding, though less-so than it used to be) along with a bunch of other numbers for characters. So, now a computer \\'knows\\' what letters are. And a human can type using a language that the computer is capable of converting to its 1s and 0s. But how does the computer know what those *words* mean? Well, you need a language. Just like we have English to communicate, computers understand languages too. With the right tools/compilers (\"dictionary\" maybe is a good parallel) a computer is able to know what your words mean. Constructing all of those words together, you have higher-order meaning like methods/aka subroutines and from there you can have things like objects, and from there you have groupings of objects that have meaning. If some of these groupings are common then programmers often call these design patterns and give them a name that they can then use to speak about at a higher level. Get all of these together and you have something that conveys the entire meaning of what you\\'re trying to say: a program or game.',\n",

Third Point: This large number can vary over time in a variety of ways, and your computer can determine the time between the delays. Say, for example, I know that the number 10 looks like a person on some theoretical computer screen. Maybe 10 looks like him with his left foot forward, and 11 looks like him with his right foot forward. Therefore, by switching back and forth between 10 and 11, I can create the illusion of a walking man.

       "    'I hope I understand your question correctly. If I do I think no one\\'s quite addressed it. I\\'m coming at this from the angle of \"What does it mean to say data on a computer drive is just 1\\'s and 0\\'s\" or perhaps \"How can a string of 1\\'s and 0\\'s actually be a computer program / game\". ----- Starting with something like a Turing machine: Imagine you have an old-school tape-recorder. So you have a long magnetic strip of tape, and a tape head which is sensitive to how the tape is magnetized (charged (1) or not (0)), and it can also write out onto the tape either 1 or zero. Being an electronics genius, you hook up a circuit to the tape recorder which does the following: * if the value under the tape is a 0 * move to the right one inch * write another 1 on the tape * if the value under the tape is a 1 * move to the left one inch * write another 1 on the tape If you set this going, it wouldn\\'t be very exciting: The initial value would be zero, so the machine would go right, and write a 1, then the value under the head would be 1, so it\\'d go left and write a 1, then the value under the head would be 1, so it\\'d go left and write another 1 and so on forever. Let\\'s say you make another circuit that does the same as the first one, but moves left instead of right when it sees a 0, and right instead of left when it sees a 1. Now you hook up both circuits to the tape-recorder, and you have a switch that allows you to toggle between them. So Lets say you modify the first circuit such that if the value it sees is a zero, it does what it did before, then switches to the second circuit. And you make the second circuit, if it sees a zero, switch back to the first circuit. Ok - so you could expand this principle, making additional circuits that write zero instead of 1, and move left instead of right, and so on depending on what\\'s underneath the tape-head. And each time you\\'d be hard-coded to switch to a different circuit. Let\\'s say you have (at least) 1 circuit where if it sees one symbol (a 1 say), it rings a bell and stops the machine to tell you it\\'s done. Groovy. Now you could start out with some set of symbols on the tape (1,0,0,1) and depending on how your circuits were set up you\\'d end up hearing a bell ring, and if you looked at the tape you\\'d have some different set of symbols on it (1,1,0,0). Exactly what symbols you end up with would depend on how your circuits were configured, but you could (for example) have a setup which put all the 1\\'s together at the beginning of the tape. This is actually the beginning of performing automatic calculations. For example if you took a base 10 number and represented it in binary (so 1 is 1, 2 is 10, 2 is 11, and so on), you could have circuits set up that would automatically increment by 1 (so 10 - >  11 or 11 - >  100, etc), or double, or add 2 numbers together, multiply by (an approximation of) pi, etc etc. and write the result out to the tape. Great - you\\'ve got a calculator. In the description so far, the tape contains raw input data (a number to double or whatever). However it\\'s also actually telling the machine what to do (go left, go right, switch to circuit \\'b\\', etc). So you could also think of it as containing a set of instructions being applied to the machine. In the case of adding 1 to the value: if I want to write out \"11\", I pass in \"10\". In fact, it could contain both -- for example - I could have a string of 1\\'s and zero\\'s that caused the machine to read the slot to the right of the string, and to the right of that, and write out the total in the two slots beyond that (Then stop and ring the bell!). This is actually a computer program, right? You\\'ve got some instructions and some raw data to perform the instructions on. Fast forward 90 years and circuits are miniaturized down to microchip size, information is written out to hard drives, and you of course are not ringing a bell and having to examine a tape to see what the results of a calculation are - instead you have hardware that responds to the instructions, displaying pixels on a screen, playing sound through speakers, etc., and of course you have a keyboard and mouse, which essentially are electronic switches picked up by the hardware and software to modify how the programs behave. And of course programs aren\\'t written by hand in 1\\'s and 0\\'s. See the programming language discussion that everyone else is linking to for more on that!  URL_0  I hope this is somewhat helpful. Disclaimers: 1) I am a programmer but I write JavaScript and some Java so deal with no low level memory management stuff directly 2) My explanation is based on my somewhat hazy memories of computability classes from University which I really haven\\'t used or revisited in 15 years, and a quick skim through the wikipedia entry on Turing machines.

       "    \"Here is a view from LOW LEVEL to HIGH LEVEL. *Processor Work. The CPU is a pretty simple concept. Transistors are devices which either let voltage through or not. They are controlled by voltage. Therefore, combine transistors together and you can make gates. [2 inputs, and if they are both high the output is high]. Ok, so now we can combine those gates to make a multiplexer [selects output], registers, memory, etc. Once those are made we can make an Arithmetic Logical Unit. It will have 3 inputs: A, B, fun. Fun selects what you want to do. For example, Fun is a two wire input, 00 is add, 01 is sub, 10 is AND, 11 is OR. Thus it will be a simple multiplexer to these operations. Then the CPU has a register called IR - instruction register. The current instructor [16 bit for example] is stored there. Individual bits go to multiplexers to control different operation for operation. For example, let's say first two bits make the CPU add/sub/add/xor. That means those two wires will go directly to Fun wires in ALU. Thus, a single instruction can be processed purely easily with multiplexers and registers. Now, there is a control register. This register gets incremented* every clock cycle. The processor then has a comparator, and if CR = 0 then it loads a new instruction in. If CR=1 then it takes the output of ALU and stores it into a register using multipexer. If CR=2 then it increments the PC [program counter]. See? Simple. We now have a very simple processor that loads an instruction, executes it and then increments PC. Now, more advanced processors have instuctions that tell CPU many more things -- like load or store from memory, talk to other chips on the board, etc. But that is not needed. Instead we will connect the output of ALU to a screen. The screen will display the colour that it gets from CPU. Then the programmer will program the memory to output the pixel to screen.\"]}},\n",

Caramelization is not the same as the Maillard reaction (browning of bread, meat etc). *The Maillard reaction requires amino acids to react with sugars, whereas caramelization does not* (it is simply the degradation of sugars with heat). They both involve browning and can occur simultaneously, on the same food base, and with similar results on the taste buds, so they are quite easily confused. 2. It is not brown because of carbon. That sort of burning requires a much higher temperature than the caramelization reaction. If you try to caramelize on too high a flame, you will see it turning black and tasting charred.

In other words:  > It is obvious to all of us that every human being is born equal, and that all of us are born with certain fundamental rights that cannot be taken away; some, but certainly not all, of these rights are the right to be alive, the right to be free, and the right to choose how to live your life. The Constitution does not give us our human rights -- they're granted to us upon birth by God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever you believe to be the source of fundamental truth. Everyone has these rights. American or foreign, bad people, good people, your worst enemy. Saints, criminals, murderers -- everyone is born with fundamental rights and they *cannot be taken away* by human beings, because who are we to remove a gift bestowed by God? Because these rights are inherent, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights don't provide them; rather, the documents provide *prohibitions on the government* from infringing on the exercise of these fundamental rights we are all born with. The Founders believed that the best government would be one that honored and protected its citizens natural rights. Now, some infringement of our rights is necessary to provide for social welfare and order, but even here, it's more about balancing the exercise of our rights; e.g., when you deny a criminal his right to freedom in order to protect other people's right to live free of physical harm. These rights are distinct in the Constitution from the Privileges  &  Immunities of citizenship, which *are* the things that we are granted as Americans. These include things like the entitlement to vote, to travel freely between states, and to have free access to commercial markets. These privileges *are* granted by the government and *can* be taken away. The Constitution recognizes the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. So, yes, illegal immigrants have that fundamental right -- they were born with it, just as you are. However, as I said, the Founders and the Constitution recognize that complete anarchy leads to greater infringement on human rights (because the strongest just takes over as tyrant), so the government is allowed enact reasonable regulations that infringe on fundamental rights to the extent that they are necessary to protect social order and welfare.

Just to add to the comments below (or, will be below once you upvote this comment - zing!): Pure mathematics, as a discipline, originates from the process of successively abstracting the ideas of concrete math. In other words, it looks for the essential structural features that make concrete math \"work,\" without the nonessential, context clues that make it concrete. Think of it like building a taxonomy of the animal kingdom by studying a bunch of animals, classifying them into categories based on their common features, then classifying those categories into categories based on *their* common features, and so on. For example, one path in mathematics might be Euclidean geometry - >  [inner product functions]( URL_5 ) - >  [norm functions]( URL_3 ) - >  [metrics or distance functions]( URL_1 ) - >  [topologies]( URL_0 ) - >  [sets]( URL_2 ) - >  [foundational axioms]( URL_4 ). At each step, \"structure is lost,\" meaning that you sacrifice some of the special properties of each for the sake of putting concepts into successively bigger groups, like squares passing to rectangles passing to quadrilaterals to polygons, or bumblebees passing to bees passing to order hymenoptera to class insecta. Anyway, the \"facts\" which hold these classifications together and connect among them are called theorems, which in order to be accepted must be able to be logically deduced from the accepted theorems \"above it\" in abstraction. For example, you can prove a statement about squares using facts about rectangles, but not vice versa. (That\\'s what makes it deductive reasoning.) The thing is, just like we could discover a new species of bee tomorrow, we could discover some new fact about a mathematical system that hasn\\'t yet been deduced. Or, perhaps more commonly, we could discover a proof -- pure math\\'s standard of demonstrating logical deduction -- for something that mathematicians \"believe\" to be true based on their knowledge of the field. How would you do that? The same way you discover a new species of bee: get familiar enough with all the existing species so that you can spot the one specimen that doesn\\'t fit the pattern, or a new pattern that no one has spotted before. In math this means immersing yourself in all the recently discovered theorems in your field, looking at how their knowledge was constructed from more general and related principles. And then go immerse yourself in those more general and related theories to understand how they work. And so on. Naturally, you typically have to start with learning a lot of general knowledge in the field, growing more specialized as you go. And then, reading a paper, you spot a theorem that you can take one step further down the line. From a logical perspective, this usually takes the form of a hypothesis you can weaken (\"All red squares are rectangles...\" Wait a minute, they don\\'t need to be red!) or a conclusion you can strengthen (\"All squares are quadrilaterals...\" Wait a minute, they\\'re more specifically rectangles!) And then you embark upon constructing a proof, borrowing recent results as well as general knowledge and often a stroke of insight and creativity to form the logical scaffold of the work. You write up your proof, submit it for publication, present it at conferences, teach it to your graduate students, rinse, and repeat. The last paragraph is probably an answer to what you were asking - the \"process\" of pure math research is difficult to describe because it is so often a slow, deliberative, and creatively frustrating search for the right pieces and the right way to put them together, like being in a room full of mismatched puzzle pieces and trying to put together a picture of the specific dog you had as a child. It can be years of labor for small amounts of progress, and there\\'s no accepted procedure, just as there\\'s no fixed procedure for designing great sculpture.

That person often ends up a dictator. At least this is how Americans perceive it. Many do not see the socialism in this country already, such as public schools, police, fire, roads, post, ect. Because of that they can not see small steps towards a better tomorrow because again they perceive it as socialism which as stated above is greatly misunderstood by the people. The final piece to this puzzle is the rising theocracy ideals in presidential candidates. The general idea for theocracy if it followed the morals they want us to believe that we should all follow wouldn\\'t be so bad, but rarely if ever has a theocracy shown to be productive and produces and entirely different and often negative style of governing from socialism.',\n",

       "    \"“Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.” Also, there is a bit of depth to this fear. I believe a lot of it stems from people who are irritated by the 'hippies who want handouts'. People usually also hold the view that they don't want their government turning into a 'nanny state' whose operations cost taxpayers extra money for its inflated bureaucracy leading to overhead costs due to the legislations made to create social welfare programs to help people, after all, the government doesn't do things as efficiently as the private, capitalist industry (/s). Lastly, [moral hazard]( URL_0 ) is a concept held closely by a lot of the intellectual anti-socialist crowd. Moral hazard is basically the idea that if you are insured from risk, you are more likely to act riskier. If your nanny state government insures you from going completely bankrupt by providing you food stamps and welfare checks, you are less likely to find a job that would help you climb out of your debts sooner. While I believe some of these talking points have important information to pull away from it, it just simply is a terribly cynical view of humanity. We don't live in a purely capitalist society right now, it operates based on 'socialist' regulations and we all drive on roads built from 'socialist' legislation. A true capitalist society means that power is achieved by capital, ie resources. And I don't see how this is any different from anarchy. In a stateless soceity, the people with the most resources will have the most influence. My biggest gripe against conservatives is the idea that social healthcare should 'never ever' be implemented because it's too expensive. It's as if they are reading this out of some bible, some rule of life. It's purely ideological. A basic, accountable form of social healthcare, one that conducts voluntary tests on its population to help prevent epidemics, is certainly a necessity. And I don't think leaving those types of responsibilities up to a deregulated/unregulated private industry who answers to shareholders first would be the best thing for society. Hence, some form of socialism is necessary for, well, our social health.\",\n",
       "    'I\\'ll address the \"what sustains it\" question, because I think understanding the origin of the fear is as simple as them being our enemies. It\\'s pretty much exactly what happens every time we have an enemy. Not only propaganda, but also the natural instincts of humans to defend their group. So, my theory for why this fear is still sustained is that communism has turned out to be the most convenient \\'other\\' for (especially right wing) politicians to use. One reason it is convenient is because by picking something radically left-wing as the enemy, you can associate our own left wing with it. Picking radical Islam as the enemy, for example, was less effective because it has helped contribute to a rise in atheism and weaken the base for the right wing. At the same time, it increased nationalism, so it wasn\\'t all bad, but I feel like the most calculating and cynical right wing politicians (hypothetical, I\\'m not trying to build strawmen here) would secretly curse the fact that it wasn\\'t FARC or some other communist faction who engineered the attacks.

As most police officers are unionized, any change to their working conditions has to be approved through collective bargaining (negotiating with the union). Union contracts often run for 3-5 years so the state can't just tell cops to start using them. Since many police union members (cops) don't want the cameras the unions can delay or prevent departments from adopting them. Police unions are often politically powerful and politicians generally don't like to ram things down their throats that they really don't want. This is why in many places they've either been slow to adopt cameras or haven't done it at all. Note: I'm not demonizing police unions. They are not the sole reason that cameras are not fully adopted. Money is probably the number one reason, but there are also privacy concerns as well.\",\n",

I was a federal cop for 5 years so I\\'ve seen both sides of the body camera \\'movement\\'. The citizens who are forcing the issue of body cameras see them as a means to catch cops doing the wrong thing which on the surface makes totals sense, but when you dig into the subject a little deeper that argument for support starts to fall apart. Employers have been monitoring their employees since the invention of closed circuit TV. Almost everywhere you go there are cameras watching both the customers and the employees...but mostly the employees. The average employee isn\\'t bothered by this because they would never do something wrong, a handful of employees are dissuaded from trying anything on camera but if they find a weak spot they\\'ll exploit it, and a select few don\\'t care about the cameras and gamble that nobody is watching. The same goes for body cameras. There are over 900,000 sworn law enforcement officers in the US and the overwhelmingly vast majority of them will spend their entire career faithfully serving the public with honor, dignity, and respect with some of them selflessly and heroically giving their live in the process. A handful of cops would be dissuaded from doing something questionable on camera but would exploit a weakness in the system if they found one, and a select few just want to watch the world burn. The numbers for \"bad\" cops are no different than the numbers for \"bad\" doctors, \"bad\" lawyers, or any other profession. Some people just suck and they choose a variety of different professions to fund their suck ass lives. So now you win and all 900,000+ cops are outfitted with body cameras and dash cams. But most of the cops would never do anything wrong and now they\\'ve got these cameras with them all the time. So what exactly are the camera\\'s purpose? They become evidence gathering tools against you and you can\\'t just think about today, you have to consider the technological advances of the future. If we mandated 100% body camera compliance tomorrow, within five years every cop would be a walking talking license plate reader/facial recognition computer. In ten years we\\'d have cameras on every street corner and on the highways because \"why pay cops to pull over speeders when you can just send them a ticket in the mail? Cops are needed for real crimes.\" You also have to take into account what this would do to our criminal justice system. When television shows like CSI became popular it had a measurable effect on the system that has been labeled [The CSI Effect:]( URL_0 )  > The CSI effect is hypothesized to affect verdicts in two main ways: first, that jurors expect more forensic evidence than is available or necessary, resulting in a higher rate of acquittal when such evidence is absent; and second, that jurors have greater confidence in forensic and particularly DNA evidence than is warranted, resulting in a higher rate of conviction when such evidence is present. While these and other effects may be caused by crime shows, the most commonly reported effect is that jurors are wrongly acquitting defendants despite overwhelming evidence of guilt. In particular, prosecutors have reported feeling pressured to provide DNA evidence even when eyewitness testimony is available. In one highly publicized incident, Los Angeles County, California District Attorney Steve Cooley blamed actor Robert Blake\\'s acquittal on murder charges on the CSI effect. Cooley noted that the not guilty verdict came despite two witness accounts of Blake\\'s guilt, and claimed that the jury members were \"incredibly stupid\".

On the other hand, if you live in a city of average size, there may be thousands of human blood samples from the community to test on any given day. Ultimately it becomes far more efficient to send the blood samples off in batches to other labs and facilities that specialize in this kind of thing. Also, some of these testing laboratories don't only cover your immediate city; oftentimes they are regional, covering numerous cities and towns in the area, leading to higher workloads and increased turnaround on results.

       "    \"It's marked up as explained, but just to add to this topic. The vast majority of blood work has a very short turn around time regardless of species. Time delays really only occur when samples have to be sent to a local laboratory for either confirmation or if the practice doesn't have the equipment to run the required test. As a couple examples a veterinary practice might have a biochemistry and a haematology analyser which will allow a vet or vet nurse to provide results within 5 minutes. These analysers are quite accurate and provide a decent snap shot typically of liver/kidney parameters along with a full blood count. These results will help a clinician to in the least start treatment, continue therapy, confirm health status. They may send the same samples on to a reference laboratory to confirm/get more detailed results. Typically a vet practice lab will have a few other smaller point of care analysers or tests that they can perform (haemoglobin, blood glucose, blood typing or simple snap ELISA). When sending a sample to a reference laboratory the samples will arrive by courier and/or local postal delivery. This obviously takes more time, but the larger laboratories endeavour to provide either same day or within 24 hours for the vast majority of samples/tests. The advantage of sending to a reference lab are specialised analysers with higher accuracy, wider range of available testing and the ability of having specialised areas (for example the company that I work for has recently developed tests for early kidney disease markers, has exclusive tests for pancreatic inflammation etc which are only available by testing at our reference laboratories). As for human testing (and this is more specific to the UK), when you have your bloods taken at your GP, they may have some simpler point of care testing machines (Blood glucose, haemoglobin, cholesterol etc) but they will be far less likely to have their own laboratory. These will be couriered to a laboratory (usually hospital based) and tested within an hour or two. The results are then transmitted (fax, email, or posted results) back to the GP surgery. Obviously if your bloods are taken at the hospital, then turn around of results will be massively reduced, but even they may have to send samples on to a specialised reference laboratory as it is generally not cost effective to provide every service under the sun if the sample numbers are low.

Some film producers/directors use \"infrasound\", as in, sound that has a frequency of below 20hz to introduce suspension or fear in the audience to enhance a scene. When you are walking on a suspension bridge and it sways, you can feel that, its still vibration, just not audible. If the bridge vibrated hard enough and fast enough, you would hear it as it would push and pull the air fast enough to make it audible. In terms of headphones, the effect of infrasound and sounds above 20khz are negligable. That\\'s because the drivers \\\\(speakers\\\\) in your headphones are more than likely too small a diameter to accurately produce those frequencies to a sound pressure level \\\\(db\\\\) that you would be able to \"feel\".',\n",
       "    'The short answer is that it doesn\\'t matter. No, you cannot perceive frequencies higher than 20 kHz, either by hearing or by vibrotactile perception (feeling it). Depending on your age, you might not be able to hear above 15-16 kHz. There are several reasons we can\\'t hear above these frequencies. The primary one is because the physical organ of hearing doesn\\'t resonate at these frequencies. The organ of hearing lies along a membrane which is narrow and stiff at one end, where it resonates more with high frequencies, and floppy and wide at the other end, where it resonates more with low frequencies. It\\'s much like piano strings. It\\'s a pretty basic physical system in that sense. Above around 20 kHz, you\\'re not going to get a lot of sympathetic vibration along the membrane. Secondly, cells (and attached nerves) are arranged along this membrane which are activated basic on frequency, with cells and nerves at the short, stiff end coded for high frequencies, and cells at the other end coded for low frequencies. This \"tonotopic\" organization is preserved all the way to the auditory cortex. As we age, we lose cells and nerves coded for high frequencies first, which is why by out teen years we start to be unable to hear up to 20 kHz. There is really no vibrotacile perception of high frequencies. It may be possible, but the level would have to be extreme, way above any potential output of an earphone. The other thing to consider is that most sound files aren\\'t going to have information in frequencies above around 20 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs is 44.1 kHz, making the Nyquist frequency (above which no information is coded), 22.05 kHz. This gets into signal processing stuff, but essentially the way the digital information is preserved is such that you aren\\'t sampling fast enough to accurately encode frequencies above about 22 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs for example was chosen at 44.1 kHz because humans cannot hear above 20 kHz, so it didn\\'t need to be any higher. There will also be a low-pass filter used which will further restrict frequency information above the Nyquist frequency in order to avoid something called aliasing. The short of that is: even if we could hear above 20 kHz, and even if headphones can reliably produce these frequencies, even if drivers can pump fast enough to create these, there aren\\'t frequencies that high present in most common audio formats. Very low frequencies you can feel, sure - but most music doesn\\'t contain frequencies below 20 Hz (most won\\'t go below probably 50 Hz), so again, unlikely to matter if the headphones can go super low. As with many audiophile things, the extended frequency range of most fancy headphones is just kind of a dick swinging contest.',\n",

Just like you might want a car that can go 150 miles per hour just because it will go from 60 - 80 for passing much better than a car that can barely get up to the speed limit. An audio amplifier or speaker that is capable of playing much louder than you need and at frequencies much higher than you need will sound better at the levels and frequencies you actually listen to.',\n",

That\\'s a 50% reduction in sound pressure (but less than a 50% reduction in perceived loudness). Now, \"theoretically\", you wouldn\\'t want performance to decrease at *all* throughout the entire audible range. If you produced speakers where that was the case, the point where response *did* decrease would be outside of the audible range. In reality, headphones/speakers never perform perfectly flat within that range, nor are those extreme frequencies any more important than other aspects of their behavior. But they have practical designs which don\\'t stop working at *exactly* 20hz or 20khz, sometimes a design that performs well in that range will also reach quite a bit higher. So, showing off those ratings is partly a pissing contest, as others noted. But one thing I will note is it suggests they **actually measured** the frequency response. If I see 20hz-20khz on a $20 pair of earbuds, I know they guessed (or lied) about that and who knows what else they guessed/lied about.

Basically what happens is, the reason why a note is given its name is because of how many vibrations a second that note is played. The most standard example is most Western music is based on A440. What that means is that the A note vibrates 440 times a second. The B note vibrates about 494, etc etc. Just an aside, that concept is kind of a cool thing to look into on it's own, but I don't want to bog this post down. The thing is, that when something like a string vibrates, it doesn't just move back and forth. Within the string are smaller vibrations. They look like [this]( URL_0 ). Those are the subharmonic frequencies. When you listen to a string, you're not really listening to a single note, but a BBQ sauce of notes that create the tone and color of the note. And like BBQ sauce where some of the flavors aren't tasted directly, some of the subharmonic frequencies are going to be too high pitched to be heard on their own, but they do influence to lower pitches that are in range.\",\n",

For speakers, going above 20 kHz is useless, but you can feel the \"rumble\" of frequencies below 20 Hz, even if you can\\'t hear them. You mostly feel this in your chest, so there is no reason to have it in headphones. Another reason you don\\'t want higher frequencies is that they can cause the membrane of the speaker to \"ripple\", instead of moving back and forth as a solid unit. This distorts the audible sound, so you do not want that. So, just another reason to cut high frequencies.',\n",

Whatever is \"extra\" is exactly that. Extra. They don\\'t care about anything above or below that range, and it\\'d be more expensive to install a low pass filter.

However, your bones still have to stay together SOMEHOW. That support then falls on the ligaments which attach those bones together and the connective tissue capsules around the joints. If you rely too heavily on the ligaments for support you can overstress them, sprain them, and inflame them leading to pain. In short, using your muscles to support your posture can be tiring.

The reason for this is because your postural muscles are designed to live in a state of tension, to fight gravity and hold you up. They are quite efficient at this, but only when used as directed. Let's focus on the upper back, which is a *slightly* more typical problem area. When you slouch, you are lengthening (stretching) your rhomboids, trap 3 and erectors (among others, but those are the main ones). When a muscle is lengthened it becomes weaker, *however*, you are still asking it to do the same amount of work. This causes knots/trigger points which cause pain. And in extreme cases/after many years of bad posture, the body starts to calcify those muscles, binding them up and creating more structure to hold you up in that non-ideal position. This causes even more problems because it starts to restrict movement and blood flow which, you guessed it, leads to even more pain. After a really long while you can even reach a point of no return where no amount of exercise or massage/physical therapy can get you back to 100%. This effect is most pronounced when you do it with your neck. Ever seen someone with a [dowager's hump]( URL_0 )? That's from 'forward head posture' and it forms from your body adding extra structure to support the weight of your head while forward. FUN FACT: your ears should be in line with your shoulder socket, and for every inch that your ears are forward from it, it doubles the weight of your head. Forward head posture also causes you to have to lift your head up so you're not always looking at the ground. This puts unnecessary strain on your occipital muscles and can cause chronic headaches. **So what can I do about it? I just get achy when I try and sit up straight!** A couple things. You get achy because those muscles are weak, you need to strengthen them. 1. Strengthen your rhomboids with ['wall angels.']( URL_1 ) so you don't get achy from sitting up straight. Do 3 sets of 10 *every day*. 2. You may find that even with these exercises and sitting up straight, that you still cannot stop rounding your shoulders and it still looks like you are slouching.

Be sure to keep your back straight, your forearm flat against the door frame, and DO use the three positions shown to stretch all three heads of pec. And remember, it's not a stretch if you don't hold it for at least 20 FULL seconds and *breathe*. 3. Strengthen your core. There are many exercises/options out there for this, but the important thing to remember is that your abdominal muscles are ALSO postural muscles and need to be strong to keep you sitting/standing up straight. Strong abs mean a posterior pelvic tilt which means non-shortened QL and low back muscles which means less low back pain! TL;DR: Use your muscles the way they were designed or pay the price later in life.\",\n",

       "    \"Why it feels good: Because it takes more muscle to hold your head and shoulders up than it does to rest your weight on your vertebrae and shoulder capsule (the cartilage on the front of your shoulder). This is true of standing, when you also have your legs and hips as a solid base. When you sit down, good posture is even harder to maintain because fewer muscles are able to help maintain good posture. Those muscles get tired in about 20 minutes. Why it's so bad: Your shoulder capsule and vertebrae are very poor structures to hold weight in this way. They wear out after a while and the result is chronic pain, and painful/restricted movement. In other words, it will make getting older suck a lot more. Tl;dr: The human body is not very good at sitting around doing fine motor skills for long periods of time. It's much better at moving around!\",\n",

       "    '\"Bad\" posture is usually a position where you\\'re allowing your weight to be passively supported by your spine instead of using your muscles to hold yourself in a neutral position. Because you\\'re not engaging your muscles as much, it feels easier to sit this way. The reason it\\'s bad for you is that it puts uneven pressures on the spinal discs between your vertebrae. While you\\'re young, you probably won\\'t notice the ill effects. Over time, everyone\\'s discs degenerate, but bad posture and other stresses will hasten that process. In terms of sitting positions, the short answer is that sitting for prolonged periods of time in any position is bad for your spine. Standing in a neutral position is far easier on your spine because your lower body bears a great deal of the weight. If you do have to sit, it\\'s important not only to keep a neutral spine position, but also to vary your position frequently. Sit completely straight sometimes. Lean back at others. Elevate your feet slightly. Stand up periodically. Doing these things will help to distribute the pressure and protect your spine over the long term.',\n",

Towards this purpose, most people do unnecessary, crazy efforts with their neck and back muscles, and they don\\'t even realize it. Some tips.

You want to stretch your spine up while sitting down. Don\\'t overdo it, this is mostly a thouoght. It\\'s incredible how giving yourself a direction can change your whole body\\'s organization. * Balance the weight of your head in your neck. While thinking up, and stretching your neck, slightly tilt your head down. Think of the center of gravity of your head, and how you should balance it in your neck. * Also think how the load your neck is receiving, goes to the spine, and is transferred nicely to your ischium. * I cannot stress this enough: YOUR BUTT SHOULD SUPPORT YOUR HEAD\\'S WEIGHT, and your spine should be just a middle man doing practically no work.

       "    'A lot of posters are saying that you need to work muscles to have aligned posture when this is actually NOT the case. \"Bad\" posture is caused by tension in the body\\'s muscles, not lack of tension (or work) in certain muscles. A person with perfect alignment wouldn\\'t have tensed muscles, but actually the opposite. The aim shouldn\\'t be to tense muscles, but to release the tension that is causing the misalignment of your spine. It\\'s important to remember that all the muscles in your body are \"connected\", in that muscles in your legs may overwork themselves to make up for unbalanced torso, etc. So although the problem may be in your upper back, to achieve better alignment you will actually have to release tension in your whole body. The first step to doing this is building an awareness of your body. Don\\'t ignore the pain in your muscles. Be aware of stiffness and allow yourself to release the tension you are holding. An exercise I\\'d recommend trying requires only two small bouncy balls. First, lie on the floor. Next, without placing your feet but rather letting them hang and drop, bring your knees toward your body so that they are pointing towards the ceiling and your feet are resting on the ground. Make sure to now take a moment to assess how your body feels. Now, take the bouncy balls and place them under your upper back between your shoulder blades but NOT under your spine. You want the balls to be higher rather than lower along your shoulder blades. This might feel somewhat painful, but allow your muscles to release into the balls. What is happening is the muscles laying over the balls are releasing tension to accommodate their shape. Keep the balls under you for a few minutes, or however long you can handle, remember to breathe into the floor. Don\\'t tense yourself either, but let yourself sink into the balls and the floor. Now, remove the balls. Stay on the floor and I guarantee you will feel an openness in your upper back. There are a lot of similar exercises, or \"preliminaries\" as they\\'re sometimes called, for different muscles. A book I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone who lives in a body is The Body Has Its Reasons by Thérèse Bertherat. It gives directions on how to perform many other preliminaries. There are also many touching and enlightening passages, but one that really struck me was about a old woman the teacher visited who had a very contorted spine and tense body. Days later, the teacher visited the woman and found her lying in bed with perfect alignment. She was dead. It makes the point that the body\\'s natural state is perfect alignment, such as we have when we are born or when we are dead. The tension that we hold throughout our life cause the pain and discomfort that many of us live in. This is a little blurb about the book that gives you an idea: \"Your body has not forgotten anything. In the stiffness, in the inhibitions, in the muscular pains of your back, of your limbs, of your diaphragm and also of your face and genitals, your entire history is revealed, from birth to today. From the first months of your life, you have reacted to pressure: “Watch your posture. Don’t touch. Don’t touch yourself. . .”. You accommodated as best you could and in thus conforming, you deformed yourself.

       "    'For much of the postwar 20th century, if you were a young white man with at least a high-school education, you had to try *not* to get a job that would fund at least a lower-middle-class lifestyle. If you had a college degree in *anything*, even English or Art History, you were pretty much guaranteed a lifetime of desk jobs, each higher-paying and more powerful than the last, with The Firm, which would then take care of you through retirement with a pension. If you came into The Firm with a Bachelors, it might actually pay your time *and your tuition* for a Masters. When you went home at the end of the night, work was generally over - there was no email. Calling someone at home was a big deal and used mostly for emergencies. (This era is largely where the perception that the unemployed are just lazy comes from. There really was a time when you had to be lazy to be unemployed.) Nowadays, you need to get into a good elementary school that will prepare you to work hard in middle school so you can take the right classes in high school to get into a good college in a handful of the \"right\" majors, and then maybe go to graduate school, to stand a *chance* of getting a good job if you\\'re also a friendly/interesting person who interviews well. Outside a handful of labor markets, your health insurance and retirement plans will be token benefits (if they exist at all). You\\'ll need to hit the streets, blast your resume around, write a ton of cover letters, and practice your interview game so you can change jobs every few years to increase your salary with your experience. Employers certainly aren\\'t handing out meaningful raises just for showing up. Your bosses may expect you to answer your cell phone or respond to texts/emails promptly late into the night. For blue-collar workers, much of this can be attributed to globalization and automation.

       "    \"In the US young people have the problem of a changing nature of labor and the contract between worker and corporation. In past few decades wages have not increased with respect to ~interest rates~ inflation, in many ways they have decreased. This means we get a larger number in terms of dollars from the companies we work for, but we receive far less value for our work. So we have to work more. We work for smaller firms generally, shops and retail, tinier operations that make unionizing and collective bargaining less viable strategies for supporting our labor's value. A major reason for the existence of unions was to combat the spreading de-humanization of work, which simply put took satisfaction out of labor and alienated people. Additionally, they helped support labor in national politics. By and large people born in the past 20 years will never join or support a union, and won't be able to offer each other support for their livelihoods. This means goods are slightly cheaper, but labor is cheaper still, so we have to work more to stay solvent. Gains in women's rights and expanded diversity have slightly offset the effects of wage stagnation, but the crisis of 2008 shows us that we won't get back to the state of the mid-90s labor. The minimum wages your parents worked for briefly as youths are the wages you will work for until you are middle-aged, when you briefly make more and then get fired and have to work for minimum wages again (on average). In the past century our labor has become a substantial portion of our identities. If you write a story about someone, the thing they spend time doing to make money is probably the first thing you use to describe them. This is Jim, an accountant, or Mary, an engineer, or Sanjeet, a flight attendant, etc. Well, now your profession will last 15 months, on average. You will change jobs many times in your lifetime as a replaceable cog in a variety of machines that don't care about you. Oh, and you won't be able to retire on the average person's wages. You'll get no pension, and once you are fired for being less productive than a computer the company you worked for will forget you ever existed.

Two the United States vs. the Soviet Union made it necessary for large government expenditure and expansion, this also created jobs. Three, women retreated from the work force after the war creating more demand for labor. These three things made it extremely easy to find good paying work. Now, lets look at housing. Housing cost from post war until about 1975 rose, roughly, with inflation. In the mid 70s the price of housing started to outpace inflation, this has accelerated so that a house in 1970 that would have cost 100k(adjusted for inflation) would have cost 200k in 1990, and today that exact same house would run half a million. These are national numbers, there are certainly places in America where this isn't the case, but it's true in most places. Next is education. I'll keep this one easy. In 1960 it cost roughly $9500 in inflation adjusted dollars to attend an ivy league school. It now costs over $40,000.

One of the reasons why vanilla is so expensive, is that the orchid has to be pollinated by hand since there is not a living population of that plant's pollinator in some of the areas the plant is cultivated for global sale.

       "    \"I am a beekeeper who specializes in phylogeny for bees. If you want to see the scientific community go into a fight where someone is going to get hurt get an entomologist together with a botanist to discuss the evolution of flowering plants and insects that pollinate them. What we can surmise so far. Plant life most likely some type of algae and or fungi come to the edge of the water line and then onto land. Eventually more complicated life forms followed which eventually includes ancestors of insects (this is such a gross oversimplification it is bad) . Remember plants though have a head start but these are not plants that necessarily flower or produce pollen. We will need millions of years to go by before that happens. However starting to play catch up are insects. Lots of them. Of all sorts of different types. Giving them a few million years and you will eventually end up with wasps which are the ancestor to bees (again a horrible oversimplification). Plants can self pollinate in the forms of pines and ginkos and a few others. Now is where things get fun. Did the plants produce fruits that would have been consumed by herbivores in order to help disperse seeds? But that is not pollination per se. You are right but remember seed production is the result of pollination. So wind pollination becomes possible for flowers but the fossil timeline does not give a definitive answer because there is an overlap with flowering plants with sticky pollen that was carried by insects and other animals. What we do know is that we have some really old plant fossils with sticky pollen and some really old plant fossils with non sticky pollen. We also have insects and animals that are evolving at the same time to work these plants and developing in such a way that this becomes beneficial to the animals and the plants at the same time. There are plants that wind pollinate without insects or other animals helping them. There are plants that must have animals or insects to help pollinate them or they don't make it. There are plants that self pollinate and don't care about either of the above groups. The aspect of co-evolution is taken very seriously here because it offers the best insight into the current data. With new discoveries things may change but it is an interesting matter of research and some of the coolest things about have been happening in the last five years. I have had to correct my talks with new information a lot because of new and wonderful information that has been showing up in the journals.\"]}},\n",

       "    \"Black holes have a lot of mystique and awe around them, but they really aren't that complicated. If you live somewhere with snow, you have probably played around with the basic concepts. Imagine we start with a cloud. It is really big. Then the cloud gets compacted. Parts of the cloud condense. It turns into snowflakes. Same amount of stuff, smaller space. The snow falls to the ground. What was once a very large part of cloud has the same mass, but is now a smaller pile of snow. Then you compact it some more. You start with a small pile of snow, compress it, and you have a snowball. Same amount of stuff, smaller space. It might be the size of a baseball. Compact it some more, you have a small iceball. It might be the size of a golf ball. Same amount of stuff, smaller space. That is exactly what happens with a black hole. The same is true for planets and for stars, black holes, and even the super massive black holes in a galactic core. Let's see how. Start with a big gas nebula. It can be hundreds of millions of miles across. But it is very sparse, like a cloud. Collapse part of the nebula and you get a star, some planets, asteroids, comets, and other material. It is much like collapsing your cloud to snowflakes. Perhaps a big star, perhaps a yellow giant or a blue hypergiant. Let's say it is a 10 million mile diameter yellow giant. The Sun is about one million miles across for comparison. Push and compact a giant star and eventually it will collapse into a neutron star. Just like collapsing your pile of snow into a snowball. It is very small and whitish, but has the same amount of stuff as the star before it. It has the same amount of gravity, just squished a bit more. The star collapses from roughly ten million miles down to roughly five miles. It shrinks to about a millionth of the size, but it still has the same amount of mass. The planets and other objects will still orbit at the same distance, assuming they survived the giant explosion that took place when it collapsed. When you read online about a supernova, it can be caused by one of the giant stars collapsing this way. The big difference with a neutron star is that since it is compressed so much, it shrunk from ten million miles to just five miles, things can get MUCH closer to the central mass. If a comet or asteroid or planet gets too close, it won't be able to escape and will eventually crash into the star. Other than that, it still has the same amount of mass, the same amount of gravity, the same amount of matter that the giant star had. It is just squished together tighter. Collapse it again and it turns into a black hole. It still has the same gravity, but because it has collapsed the things near the center are able to get closer to the central mass. What started as a ten million mile star, or a hundred million mile nebula, or a five mile neutron star, has been squished down to the size of a large marble, probably just a few inches across. It still has the same amount of stuff in it, and again any nearby planets or other objects orbiting it that survive the explosion will continue to orbit exactly the same. It gets so small, so tight, that now stuff that could have only come within a few miles of it can now come within inches of it. Just like before, things that get too close cannot escape, and will eventually crash into the star. The difference is that at some distance near the star, perhaps only a mile or two away from the tiny marble, not even light can escape directly. But these very tiny objects still have the same mass, 10^32 or 10^33 kg of mass, just squished down really tight. Black holes are just really squished stars. A cloud that was once millions of miles across has been squished down to the size of a marble. They still move around, they still do what stars do, they are still just a really tightly compacted iceball. The only difference between a black hole and a star is they are just so squished that light has a hard time escaping. Anyway, the centers of galaxies are super massive black holes. They are like thousands of stars that have been squished down, just like you can squash a whole yard worth of snow into one snowman. The stars are squished and squished and squished, maybe down to the size of a basketball or the size of a small building. They might have a mass of 10^36 kg, give or take an order of magnitude. They have so much mass that millions of stars (including black holes) orbit around them. These galactic cores also move around. We have a local cluster of galaxies that are all moving around. The galactic cores, those collections of super massive black holes, are moving in their own dance around the universe. We have the Canis Major Galaxy, and the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, that are already crashing into the Milky Way Galaxy. We are on a collision course with another, the Andromeda Galaxy. It was just on the news that scientists updated when the Milky Way is expected to crash into Andromeda. We still have around 3 billion years, so we'll be long dead, but our Sun will likely entering old age when the Milky Way collides with Andromeda and will probably become a big elliptical galaxy. Our local cluster of galaxies is part of an even larger dance with other clusters of galaxies, all moving around crashing into each other.\",\n",
       "    'Note: Movement through space is entirely relativistic. One can only determine the movement of objects in relation with another object. For example , on Earth , if we were to observe the universe , we would come to a conclusion that we are stationary - that we are not moving in space, and that everything else is. The same goes for black holes. If one were to observe the universe at the location of a black hole , one would conclude that it too, like the previous observation , is stationary, and that other objects are rotating around it. Therefore, as to wether or not black holes are moving through space depends on the perspective in which one is observing through.',\n",
       "    'A few misconceptions here. First, the expansion of the universe is not motion. It\\'s space itself that expands, not objects that move through space. You can think of it as two ants on an inflating balloon: even if the ants don\\'t move, the distance between them will increase. Similarly it\\'s possible for two black holes to drift apart due to space expansion, while staying \"motionless\". But that leads to our second point: There is no such thing as a motionless reference in the universe. There is no favored reference frame to which you can compare objects and determine if they are moving or not. There is nothing you can anchor to. It\\'s all relative. A black hole that is motionless relatively to a specific reference frame will be moving compared to an infinity of other equally valid reference frames. Third, mass doesn\\'t prevent *motion*, it only makes *acceleration* more difficult. That is, a black hole that is moving will keep moving at the same pace until you apply a force to it. Also the mass of black holes may be very big but it is not infinite, meaning a force applied to it will have a small effect, but it will have an effect.',\n",
       "    'Absolutely. There\\'s a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy right now. In fact, there\\'s one at the center of every galaxy, and it\\'s theorized that galaxies formed because of stars and debris being attracted to these black holes - basically, everything in the galaxy orbits the back hole the same way everything in our solar system orbits the sun. As all galaxies move through space, so do their centers. In fact, it could very well be that the black holes are the primary objects being moved; the rest of the objects in the galaxy follow. Think of it like this: when you make a model of the solar system, all the planets are attached to the sun. Now make a model of the solar system where the sun model is a weather balloon and let it go. The weather balloon is moving, and because of that, so are the objects attached to it. Also, as others have noted, a black hole should not be thought of like a literal hole. The \"hole\" portion of the name likely comes from it\\'s dark appearance. It\\'s really a sphere of matter, similar to a star or planet. You don\\'t get to see the matter though, you can only see the event horizon, which is the gravitational field around this sphere of matter. It\\'s black because the matter is so densely compact that the gravity is too strong for light to escape. Of course, I\\'m not an astronomer or cosmologist, so I\\'m only stating my somewhat limited knowledge here. If any of the information is incorrect, feel free to correct me!',\n",
       "    'Think of it this way. Everything in space is \"falling\". You, me, the stars, planets, comets, dust particles, etc are all in a big free fall in a vacuum. Through observation, everything seems stationary because of the incomprehensible amount of empty space in the universe. Since mass warps the fabric of space, large objects influence smaller object\\'s trajectory (this includes matter and light or energy) influencing them and creating orbits. But still even with gravity, everything is \"falling\". Black holes, even with their copious amount of mass twisting and distorting the space-time fabric, are not an exception to this principle. They still follow Newton\\'s laws of motion. So yes, there is no \"anchor\" so to speak and they are moving along with all the other matter and energy around them.',\n",

In order to coordinate processes that cells communicate to each other via little messengers (Semiochemicals). These biochemical substances tell the cells what is going on and what to do. Now in case of an injury, let's say a scrape on your arm, this organization of cells goes out of balance for a short moment. Many repair cells are suddenly activated, that need to restore the skin. The cells have to be really quick in doing so, to ensure the fastest possible healing process. To avoid blood loss and an increased risk of infection, the cells must be reinforced and, most of all, quickly communicate with each other. The messangers (Histamine) have a little side effect, which is causing itchiness. Since the wound is very sensitive, it is irritated by these messengers. Thus we feel the itch. ;)\",\n",
       "    \"Just as a general point about evolution, not every individual trait is positive; A negative trait could be an unintended result of a different, positive trait. Take this itching thing. As others have pointed out it's caused by part of the immune system response to an injury. This immune response is very positive for preventing infection, so it has to stay. Now not itching at all is negative, if you didn't itch at all that would prevent you from knowing that insects were biting you etc. so itching in general has to stay too. Evolving a combination of not itching specifically on wounds without losing either of those 2 other traits (which would be worse than scratching a wound) is probably too much of a leap for natural selection so it hasn't happened yet.\",\n",
       "    \"The itchiness in healing wounds is caused by the same substance that causes itchiness in mosquitoes and other insect bites: histamine. Histamine is a protein involved in the body's inflammatory response to pain and it allows white blood cells to pass through the blood vessels to the attack infection in a wound. However, it also causes irritation to the nerve endings in the affected area, causing us to scratch. The itching can be reduced by applying a cold compress which numbs the nerve endings in the wounded area, or by taking anti-histamines (found in many anti-allergy medications) which block the brain's sensitivity to those irritated nerve endings.\",\n",

The answer to why our bodies do anything is: Either natural selection bred it in it because it helps us survive, or it has no meaningful negative impact on our survival so natural selection didn\\'t bother to breed it out. In this case, I\\'m guessing the latter -- the itching is a side-effect of a needed process and most of us likely have always had enough sense to not pick at a wound enough to cause death/sterility, so it stuck around. Edit: By \"bred it in/out\" I mean that the genes causing the trait occurred (arguably by random) in an individual or family line, and if they made a difference in whether the individual(s) survived to breed, and whether that offspring carrying the genes had the same breeding advantage/disadvantage, the genes would spread or die out.

I figured this was true since if you pick at a scab before it is ready, it bleeds again. If you just wait until it's ready and starts itching, the outer edges itch the most and come off the fastest. Over the next several days the itchiness continues and the scab becomes smaller and smaller until one day it completely comes off.\",\n",

       "    'Itching early in the wound healing process is created from histamine. Histamine has been scientifically proven to increase the rate of healing. But it does not itself cause the itching - it causes inflammation and this makes your nerves go nuts. Your skin is covered in nerves and cells that cause the itching sensation from either mechanical motion (bugs, wind, etc), chemical interaction (irritants), and very low-voltage electrical signals. A scientist discovered that the voltage at the base of a wound is different from the regular voltage of the skin elsewhere. Why this is the case is up for debate but the mechanism at work here is that new nerve cells can follow this ever-decreasing electrical signal so they know where to go. Once there and bonded with other nearby cells the wound slowly pulls itself closed. Or if this is early in the process the bonds are stretched and pulled at by the histamine-aided inflammation and produces the same result. Both the inflammation and the repair cause a small variation in the electrical signal and simulate motion. The inflammation or removal of inflammation is the movement and the nerve cells getting the local voltage back to normal is the electrical. Combined, these make your wounds itch like a motherfucker. There may be other things at play here but this is what we can prove.',\n",

So. The original USB cable had the rectangular plug we all know, meant to be plugged into your computer or whatever else was supposed to power the USB device (if any).

That variant consists of a plug with a notch in the middle, and it's designed so its corresponding jack can still connect with Micro-B devices made prior to the introduction of USB 3.0. You'll see that one half of that notched plug looks exactly like the original Micro-B plug you've come to know. **Shuri, you wrote a fucking novel again.

As it\\'s been pointed out in the other comments, people are against the requirement to conduct a background check if you have a gun of your own that you\\'d like to sell. * **Including personal transfers in the background check requirement would stop more gun crimes** - The majority of gun crimes are committed either by people who have *illegally* obtained a gun by theft or by people who had a legal right to purchase a firearm, in which case, why would extending the reach of current checks to include personal sales have any impact on those legal purchases? * **Current background checks don\\'t bar mentally unstable people from buying guns** (based on your comment) - Mentally unstable people are already barred from purchasing firearms. California is a prime example of what happens when you allow gun control politicians to have an unfettered ability to enact the gun control they desire. CA counties require you to [*prove* you have a pressing need for a concealed carry license]( URL_3 ). At one time, they required gun merchants to send a list of all gun purchasers to the state every month. [They imposed heavy restrictions on the purchase of ammunition]( URL_0 ). CA bans the sale of certain rifles that [use special features on magazines]( URL_2 ). The point is, the gun control politicians know they can\\'t outrightly ban firearms so instead they make it as onerous as possible to own or obtain firearms, accessories, and ammunition. The rifle most gun control groups want to ban is the AR-15 even though handguns are the weapon of choice for mass shooters. Their reason for attacking the AR-15 seems to be that it *looks* military or scary, not that it\\'s any more lethal than a handgun. Many groups even intentionally or unintentionally misstate that an AR-15 is capable of fully automatic fire. The accessories they try to ban have nothing to do with the lethality of the AR-15 ([barrel shrouds]( URL_1 ), pistol grips, and flash suppressors. So the argument that there\\'s a \"gun show loophole\" is false. The argument that the majority of mass shootings occur because there is some flaw in the background check system is false. It\\'s not that people are against mandatory checks, which is why there are in fact mandatory checks. Rather, it\\'s that people object to gun control politicians from trying to make it onerous for legal purchasers to purchase or own something that they have a constitutional right to own.']}},\n",

The viral load in these bodily fluids only becomes high enough to infect another person AFTER he or she begins to show simptoms of illness. The combination of these two traits means that out in everyday society, where we avoid sick people and cover our sneezes, the disease doesn't spread very quickly. When these sick people are admitted into a hospital, the medical professionals that work there are in almost constant contact with this sick person. Though the medical professionals may have safety equipment in the form of barriers to avoid contact with the bodily fluids that transmit infection, the huge frequency of exposure to the sick person means that the risk of an accidental infection (such as accidentally contaminating yourself while disrobing from the protective gear) is significantly higher.

The first thing is that while Ebola requires contact to bodily fluids, it appears that Ebola transfers very easily when there is such contact. This is in contrast to HIV, which is not easily spread even when there is a contaminated needle stick. I mean, with HIV, the calculated risk of infection is only 1/200 if you're having vaginal sex with an infected woman. So while Ebola requires contact with bodily fluids, it appears to be much more contagious than other diseases that doctors normally see once you do touch bodily fluids. Furthermore, most hospitals in the United States are not equipped to deal with quarantine situations. I said that doctors, prior to getting out of their personal protective equipment, should dip their gloves in a bleach solution and spray themselves with Lysol. He said that they have no facility at his hospital to do so. You just take your gloves off and hope you don't smear yourself with it. You might double bag just to be sure.

The biggest factors were that there weren't protocols for dealing with that patient in that hospital, there weren't specially trained people to deal with it, and the CDC did not get their team in place fast enough. Ebola is not contagious before symptoms appear and it doesn't really get bad until 72 hours after your fever escalates over 101. At Emory, a specialized team of 40 is trained to deal with patients with Ebola and are the only health care workers that come into contact with the patient or their body fluids. At Dallas, they had almost a hundred different people in contact with that patient, and they treated the patient like a normal droplet/contact isolation at first. I'd say that it is a testament to the low R0 of the disease. We have now formed an Ebola team at my hospital that consist of 34 people. The CDC has made arrangements so that any patient that is confirmed to have Ebola will be transfered to a regional center that has been set up within 72 hours. I'm on that team, and I'm not worried even if we do get a patient. I know what I'm doing, understand the disease, and we are well trained. I equate the panic to the Aids epidemic of the 80s where people didn't understand the virus and thought you could get it from hugging a patient or even using the bathroom. There are many other things I would worry about more than Ebola. I almost lost a friend to meningitis, and I watched an 18 year old girl die from the flu last year.

A LOT, I'd dare say the majority of patients are sitting down on chucks pads (basically, diapers spread out without velcro) because they're too sick/physically unable to make it to the bathroom. This means the nursing tech (usually 1 per unit....1 unit is anywhere from 10-16 or so patients) is essentially going room to room much of the day cleaning patients bed sheets and wiping their asses for them, literally. Gloves are great. Gowns are great. They aren't perfect though. And when you're doing it THAT often, its just a numbers game. NOW, think about how that nurse tech is one person going room to room. One mistake in one room is enough to potentially spread whatever germs to each person in the entire unit.

       "    'Hi, just an example: When my daughter was 2 years old, she got Rota-Virus. It is pretty nasty, because you lose fluid and electrolytes through diarrhea and vomiting. It can be transmitted through fluids and air. We took her to the infection hospital and my wife spent the night there. I took over in the morning. Our daughter was pumped with fluids and electrolytes (IV) throughout the night and in the morning she recovered enough to be hungry. I was allowed to take her home on the same day. My wife got the symptoms that very day. I got them one day later. Here I can state that I never contracted anything else from my daughter – virosis or flu, despite taking care of her when she got it. It is simply the fact that when you change diapers 20 times a day, there is a good chance you´ll miss something and get it into your system. I lost 6 kg in 4 days, feeling my body being drained of fluids. Good thing is that as a grown man, you can force yourself to drink and eat despite the symptoms and push through. I have heard of grown people being hospitalized because of Rota-Virus and I don´t think that it can compete with Ebola any more than sniffles do. I learned to appreciate child creme at the time. Wiping 20 times a day can be...sandpapery. :)',\n",
       "    \"Let me try to explain the logic here.*** The elevated risk for health professionals isn't limited to Ebola. Hospitals are, ironically, high risk places to get sick. Patients recovering for extended periods in hospitals, especially those taking antibiotics that kill most of the natural, balanced, healthy bacteria in our bodies, are more likely to get sick during their stay than they would at home. Increased risk of infection is especially true if you're a healthcare worker. They are directly exposed to contagious people and a bacteria/virus-filled environment more than your average person. It's not really *because* it's Ebola; it simply makes sense that people with direct exposure to the fluids of a sick person are more likely to get sick from them. It's the same with most any illness. Ebola in particular isn't easy to spread, but it is extremely infectious. The distinction is that while it's harder to physically spread around, just one glob of infected mucus or one pinprick of an infected needle is enough to compromise a healthy immune system. So, while you're not likely to get Ebola from sitting near someone with it, you are likely to get it if you ingest their mucus or blood. (gross!) ^^^^*** ^^^^I ^^^^am ^^^^not ^^^^an ^^^^expert\",\n",
       "    \"Mental fatigue and the misplaced assumption of infallibility. Ask yourself why so many people get horrible infections, like c. difficile, during hospital stays every year - even though basic antiseptic hand washing easily prevents the spread of infection. Worse yet, typically those with compromised immune systems, and the elderly tend to get c.diff far more easily, and those persons are so fragile to begin with - the infection can quite easily flick that first domino that starts them on a downward struggle to a premature end. The sheer number of people who move around hospitals as infection vectors makes controlling infection extremely difficult. It's not just doctors and nurses. Maintenance workers, housekeeping, orderlies that perform patient transport, support staff delivering meals, and swarms of friends and family visiting. All these people touch handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and walk past those GoJo santiizing foam dispensers with nary a second thought. Hospitals are **great** places to get sick.

       "    \"The hardest part of pathogen isolation is when removing the protective gear worn while in contact with patients. In some hospitals in Africa, they bathe the doctors/nurses with what is essentially slightly deluded chlorine-bleach after every layer of protective gear is removed. This same protocol was not adopted in the US, however they have methods that are just as effective. It is relatively difficult to isolate the pathogen from every single layer, every single time someone exits an isolation room with a patient. Some of the virus may have accidentally been transferred in that period. As an example of this, you can put on a pair of rubber gloves and cover your hands in chocolate syrup. Now, try to take off the gloves without getting any syrup on your skin. It's pretty tricky, but not impossible, but imagine having to do that multiple times per day. Again, not impossible, but its relatively easy to slip up once. Source: most of family works in health care around the country.\",\n",

It\\'s not as hardy as c. diff infection from what I understand. It\\'s in a range similar to other infections like meningitis, influenza, viral diarrhea outbreaks. The cases in texas were also very high risk exposure.

The problem is when you take it off. Not only that, but your vision is altered, and it gets super hot in those things. So, when you're taking it all off, it needs to be done in teams. The process of safely removing the equipment can take 30-40 minutes. So imagine, you're in this suit and you're burning up. Maybe you have someone helping you. Maybe you don't.

If it stays on surfaces after someone touches it, can be spread through the air, etc. Infectious refers to how much virus needs to be present in order to infect someone. Ebola is highly infectious but not that contagious. The virus can only be spread by bodily fluids after a person has enough of the virus to show clear signs that they are sick. So the person can't wander around unknowingly infecting people. Unfortunately only a few virus bodies are required to infect someone, because it is good at evading the immune system. Hospital workers are exposed to the bodily fluids at the worst possible time, increasing their risk. The people most at risk of catching it are those that care for an Ebola victim. It's really sad.

Most of the class attendees couldn't have cared less about the course content; they were just there to get the required continuing education credits so they could keep their professional certifications.

Between the bones are small, spongy shock absorbers called intervertebral discs. The discs are made up of two parts: the outer part is like a stiff cartilage, like your ear, and the inner part is like a jelly-type stuff. Think of having a small jelly donut between the bones in your neck. There is a small forward curve in your neck called a lordosis. When you sit slouched or bend your head forward, the lordosis straightens. This puts stress on the front side of the discs in your neck, and some of the jelly can push out of place if you stay in this forward bent position too long. When you sleep on your back and your head is being supported by your pillow, your lordosis temporarily goes away, and pressure may be placed on the front of your jelly donut discs. The jelly pushes out of place, pinches a nerve, and you wake up with pain and difficulty moving your neck. As you move around a bit, the jelly squeezes back into place, and in a few hours or days, you\\'re back to normal. If the jelly pushes out of place a whole bunch, then you\\'ve got a serious problem. To prevent a stiff neck in the morning, sleep with a neck roll tucked into your pillowcase to support the forward curve in your neck.

So the machine will play the song, and then try to match the song it just heard to all the songs in the library. When it finds a close enough match, it’ll add the value linked to the song to the tally of money entered. Sometimes machines can only recognize the song from side a of the bill, and it’ll show you that you have to insert the bill face up. Some machines know both sides. Also, because bills get handled and bent up and disfigured, sometimes the song doesn’t play right and the vending machine can’t find a match. In these cases, the machine will spit the bill back out.

It\\'s easy to say that America has the most liberal gun laws of western industrialised nations and also the highest intentional homicide rate of western industrialised nations not currently in a state of war, but it might be slightly more complicated than that. For example, Germany has some of the world\\'s strictest gun laws and does have a very low murder rate compared with the US, but the worst school shootings in recent decades have taken place in Germany. It is very hard to escape the fact that liberal gun laws coupled with a general culture of violence plus inadequate treatment of psychiatric disorders are to blame, but to what extent each of these factors is to blame is not easy to determine. If we pick on just the gun ownership aspect, the cases normally raised in these discussions are Switzerland and Australia. Switzerland has a very high incidence of legal gun ownership, but the usual explanation that \"all Swiss citizens are legally required to have guns\" isn\\'t quite accurate. In fact, most Swiss males in their twenties and thirties are conscripted into the militia, and are required to take their service weapons home with them -- but are not allowed to take any ammunition. (In the past, ammunition was issued in sealed boxes, and the seals were constantly checked and the bullets counted.) Still, most Swiss households have guns, and it is possible to get hold of ammunition. And it is true that despite that, Switzerland has a very low murder rate. Interestingly, though, while planned crimes -- armed robbery, for example -- are typically carried out using illegally held weapons, there is a higher-than-expected rate of domestic homicides -- crimes of passion -- and these are carried out using legally-held service weapons. So if you want to hold up a bank, you get a gun on the black market that can\\'t be traced to you; if you catch your wife in bed with the insurance salesman, you grab the nearest weapon to hand which happens to be a gun. Similarly, there is this thing going round that guns are now banned in Australia and that as a result the murder rate has shot up. Neither of those things are true: guns were restricted in 1996, but not banned, in Australia, and the murder rate appears to have gone down but was always very low anyway. Different researchers have come up with very different interpretations of the same figures, but it seems that gun crime was on the way down anyhow, and the 1996 legislation didn\\'t make much difference. The only thing anyone can say for sure is that fewer suicides are committed using guns, which just means that people determined to kill themselves are turning to different methods. TL;DR: It\\'s much more complex than lots of people will have you believe, but it is almost certainly a mixture of many different factors.',\n",

If the media kept these things to dumbed down reports that didn't seen to focus on the shooter so much then maybe we would have less maniacs. Not saying it would solve the problem completely, it just would help. Ratings are more important to news people than preventing another ratings boost.\",\n",

All testaments and parties have to be documented and sent to the police to be able to renew your license. Also you must keep firearms locked in a steel gun cabinet. Although not checked, this is for safety sake and chance of theft. If your caught breaking any of these rules, bye bye gun. If your caught with an unlicensed gun, it's straight to jail.

Somewhat related: Public shootings ended by civilians with legally concealed firearms incapacitate active shooters much more quickly and are statistically less deadly than active shooters stopped by police or security.

When Harris and Klebold shot up their high school and subsequently committed suicide, they were know to play Doom and Wolfenstein 3d, both popular FPS games at the time. The media talked about this a lot and blamed other things like music more than the other factors, like social climate (H and K were known to socially isolated from their peers, insecure, and depressed), prescription drugs (H had Fluvoxamine (known to cause suicidal thoughts and behaviours, as well as mania) in his bloodstream during the shooting), and mental illnesses (H was a clinical psychopath with a superiority complex and K was depressive, both were also bullied).

       "  'output': {'60473315': ['There are a number of stereotypes about sexuality in women in modern society, and many of them are problematic. The major one when it comes to rape, is that a woman’s value lies in her genitals, and that sex is an object or ‘treat’, that a woman can ‘give’ or ‘grant access to’. To say it as simply as possible (minding that it is more complex than this), if someone believes that they are ‘owed’ sex (whether it be because they have been dating someone for a while, because they are married, or even just because they were being flirted with), and they are sufficiently violent, frustrated or mentally unstable, they may try to ‘take’ the sex that was ‘owed to them’. The ‘empowerment’ idea comes from reinforcing the idea to women (and men) that women are not objects, or gate keepers to sex, but muti-dimensional **people**. Who have choice. And the choice to say no is one that they are entitled to. (Subnote: Not all rape occurs in a dark alleyway with a stranger. A lot of the time, it is someone known, or dating; where the woman is either too afraid/feels unable to say ‘no’, or the man does not listen to that ‘no’.)',\n",
       "    \"Firstly, a large proportion of rape/sexual assault is male on female. With that in mind, *feminist* is something of a misleading term. I am male, but also a feminist. I suspect most of my friends are 'feminists' without really realising it. Do you think that women fundamentally deserve less than men? If not, you're a 'feminist'. A lot of rape is predicated around the idea of power over someone else, and it is the case in some societies that men's perceived superiority over women makes it okay to discount their feelings. Some women actually believe this too, which is all the more surprising. By 'empowering women' to fight for gender equality, they send the message that rape is a heinous crime that men and women alike should scorn the perpetrators of.\",\n",
       "    \"I can offer my female perspective which is more generally related to women's empowerment than rape. Education is the number one thing that would help women in countries with a poor record of women's rights and therefore higher rape / child marriage / abuse records. A woman who's had a chance to learn, to grow up without the role of wife and mother thrown at her before she's completed secondary school is a woman who is going to fight hard for her rights. If you look at the history of feminism you'll see educated women are treated better, have more choice and fight hard for their rights. Women who are married off young don't realise they may have other choices. Access to birth control. That's another huge step in empowering women. I cannot believe that there are still so many women being denied the basic right to choose if and when they should have children. In many societies women are still considered the primary child carers (which I think is bullshit, having been raised primarily by my dad) which means that when they become pregnant, usually at a young age, their whole life is fucked before its begun. Having a child is a choice you should make mutually with your partner, not something you have no say in. Religion seriously needs to rethink its stance in women. I'm an atheist but I have no issue with people who follow a religious faith. What I do have an issue with is people using arguments and writings than are thousands of years old as a template for his women should behave in this day and age. If we had left our medical practices the same we'd all be dying like flies but the mainly male religious leaders seem perfectly happy to ask women to stay in roles that were outdated a thousand years ago. Because they benefit from it. And the biggest thing for me is the right to speak out without fear of reprisal or hostility from authority figures. If women don't have a right to voice their abuse then society is failing them. This occurs even in western 'feminist' societies. Here in the UK there was a specialist rape case unit within the main police force. They have been investigated and officers fired for, among many things, flat out lying about cases being dropped by the victim, joking privately about women 'asking for it' and in one memorable case they pinned a rape victims underwear to their notice board because they thought they were sexy. Add this to the fact that most women are raped by someone they know and you have the fear of breaking families or friendships coupled with the fear that no one will believe you and a less than willing police force and its clear to see why so many women just don't report rape. TL:DR treat us like people, educate us, stop telling us god wants us to be second class citizens, give us the right to choose our pregnancies and for fucks sake, believe us when we report it.\",\n",
       "    'Uhh, well, an example would be India. There is an ongoing scandal in India where a woman was gang-raped, which really highlighted the rape culture in India. Essentially, the culture of India is *very* objectifying of women. Not in the \"video game characters have boobs\" way but in the way that women are *constantly* groped and harassed in public. Rape is a big problem because it happens a *lot* but the culture is very, very dismissive of it. They rush to blame the victim for wearing the wrong clothes, for being in the wrong place, and even the police discourage woman rape victims from pressing charges. The idea is that rape cultures contribute to rape, either from rapists thinking rape is \"okay\" or \"justified\" in certain circumstances, or rapists think something that *is* rape, isn\\'t rape, or because at=large rapists aren\\'t being arrested and convicted because nobody gives a shit, and because the women are too afraid to come out and say she was raped because that would bring shame on her family. The solution to this is to \"\"\"\"empower\"\"\"\" women. Instead of being viewed as objects for sexual gratification in a man-controlled world, women should be on parity with men. If women in India were equal to men and there weren\\'t extremely restrictive gender roles, then maybe people would stop treating women like crap, and stop off-handedly dismissing rape. The reason I octuple-quotes \"empower\" is because you seem to have an issue with that word. Empower doesn\\'t mean to give women *more* power than men. At least, that isn\\'t its intent, even if some feminists go a bit overboard. My suggestion is to not get so hung up on words, and focus on the ideas.',\n",

Christianity is a world religion, and has become very aggressive about translating its holy texts into whatever languages its people speak. The original languages of the Bible are Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. What we call \"Modern English\" didn\\'t exist until shortly before the time of Shakespeare - and the King James Bible. There are earlier English translations, but they\\'re even more difficult to read for people nowadays. The influence  &  staying power of the King James Version comes from a couple of things: the translation was made after the invention of the printing press, so it was widely available. The translation was authorized by the Church of England, which used it exclusively, so anywhere that the C of E had influence, the KJV did too: it wasn\\'t too long after the KJV was published that the British Empire circled the globe, bringing British culture and religion with it. And the KJV was, for its time, the best English translation available. There are other translations of the Bible made about that time and later, but for centuries the KJV remained dominant for the reasons above. But languages change over time, and the meanings of words change. Eventually re-translation is necessary. The last century has produced a number of very good English translations now widely used by English-speaking Christians. (My favorite is the English Standard Version, first published in 2001.) But because the KJV was the dominant translation for so long, its language has become entrenched in English-speaking society. And people like tradition. It feels weird to change how a holy text reads or sounds. People stick with what they know or what they\\'re used to. Therefore the KJV is still around and will still be around for many years.',\n",
       "    'Christian pastor, college prof, academic writer here. The vast majority of Christians do not prefer the KJV over the translations in their language or ones that are more modern. Some are vehemently opposed to anything but KJV, King James Only-ist, and they have been mentioned. This is rare but very energetic. I don\\'t fight with them, I just tell them I pledge to obey and believe the KJV, too. They tend to be conspiracy theorists that think that other translations have been damaged. And 9/11 was an inside job. As others have mentioned the Bible wasn\\'t \"written\" but translated from manuscripts that came from real historical figures and groups. These manuscripts number in the thousands, with many, many copies of each book spread all over the Ancient Near East, Egypt, Asia Minor. That\\'s much better than having one \"original\" manuscript as far as increasing or improving certitude. One \"original\" can always be faked. But thousands of almost identical copies spread over the known world can\\'t be faked. Copies buried in a cave can\\'t be faked. So the KJV was translated from a group of manuscripts available during the 1600s that were pretty good, though not as good as the ones we have now, and that\\'s enabled us to clear up some confusion about certain words--not teachings, not doctrines, just very fine adjustments in the precise word or semantic range of a word. So modern translations are generally better, although some have been influenced by modern gender-equity issues to make them neutralize pronouns and things like that--I\\'m not for it. If the Bible is a very male oriented book, then for truth\\'s sake, make that clear in your translations. But even then, we are talking about whether we use it or he. Not a big issue (except in Galatians 3-4). And then not a big issue except for scholarly types.',\n",
       "    'National Geographic [published an article]( URL_0 ) a few years ago, which speaks to both the poetics and the influence of the KJV on the English language. It\\'s worth a read. Curiously, there are some concepts that are holdovers from the KJV that are so ingrained in the Christian tradition that they\\'ve persisted into an era in which other English translations are preferred. For example, everyone knows that Moses parted the Red Sea, despite that this is evidently a mistranslation, and should be the \"Sea of Reeds\". The latter could perhaps describe wetlands and tidal flats that would make more geographical sense. Another holdover from KJV is that we largely still infer that Jesus was a carpenter, owing to the stated profession of his father. However, the word given for Joseph\\'s profession is tekton, which is also used for stonemasons. The KJV translators were largely from Western and Northern Europe, and went with \"carpenter\". However, contextual clues would seem to suggest stonemason. Stories about Jesus routinely find him using analogies about building with stone. \"The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,\" although here, \"cornerstone\" may actually read \"head of the arch,\" which would suggest not only a stone analogy, but also an understanding of the construction of a Roman arch. There are metaphors about safe places to build, adding rooms to houses, etc, all of which were stone structures. But, KJV established certain readings, and they outlive that particular translation.',\n",

Tree = tree even if the description sounds what we would call in English a bush. 2) They try to figure out the idea they were trying to get across and use the best words in English to convey what was trying to be said, and that's what they translate it to.

The Bible, whichever translation you use, is a collection of books and letters written thousands of years ago. The New Testament was written by Jesus\\' contemporaries. These original works were written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. The King James Bible was the English translation commissioned by King James of England. Personally, I prefer the NKJV (New King James Version) because I think it\\'s a more accurate translation. For example, the KJV says, \"Thou shalt not kill.\" whereas the NKJV says, \"You shall not murder.\" (Exodus 20:13) The NKJV recognizes that, just like English, Hebrew has several words to describe taking the life of another person. (Murder, kill, manslaughter, homicide, patricide, etc.) It\\'s hard to argue that the Bible doesn\\'t contradict itself if it says \"thou shalt not kill\" and then the Lord tells the Israelites to kill the Canaanites. However, if you understand that killing someone in a field of battle in defense of your nation is not the same as cold-blooded, premeditated murder, then the NKJV correctly translates this and avoids the appearance of contradiction.',\n",

       "    \"(wall of text incoming, but it's relevant to the question.. bear with me!) In the early 16th century, the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus tried to compile a 'New testament in Greek' as a comprehensive version didn't really exist and there were doubts about the quality and integrity of the few manuscripts that were available for study around that time. The New Testament texts had been written around 50-150 AD (as is commonly accepted) but around the 15th/16th century, most known Greek manuscripts were only a couple of hundreds of years old - anything older was either lost and forgotten in monasteries all over Europe, or worn out beyond use, or decomposed due to the age of the biological materials used to write on, for instance. So, Erasmus studied the few manuscripts he could find and, in 1516, published the first edition of his New Testament in Greek - which became popularly known as the 'Textus Receptus' (TR for short) There were several revised editions later, as more/earlier manuscripts were found in monasteries and such and textual variants were discussed, accepted or rejected. For a long time, the TR was the gold standard of Greek New Testament - and it had a large influence on the KJV; the translators that made the KJV made extensive use of it. You could even say that the KJV is largely based on the TR! Now - Erasmus lived in northwestern Europe. The manuscripts (parchments) he could study, came from the western church, via Byzantium (eastern Roman empire). In later centuries, howver, archeology and other research yielded many new texts for study, not parchments from the western (byzantine) tradition, but from sources in Egypt for instance: papyri, often much older than the parchments Erasmus had. Some of these papyri are dated to the second and third century AD, which brings ur much close to their time of writing, when compared to what Erasmus had to work with! These texts are sometimes called 'alexandrian' (from Alexandria in Egypt), to distinguish them from the western 'byzantine' texts. Slowly but surely, the influence of these alexandrian texts grew. And newer compilations of a Greek New Testaments (such as Nestle Aland) which replaced the Textus Receptus, made good use of the more ancient alexandrian sources, with their own unique textual variants. This leads to textual differences with the Textus Receptus of course! So how is this relevant to the usage of the KJV today? Well, most newer bible translations no longer use the Textus Receptus as source, but newer compilations such as the already metioned Nestle Aland. But, there is a specific subset of christians that do not accept the alexandrian textual variants as valid; they consider them corrupted by gnostic influences and/or other early heresies, or by theologians such as Origenes for example. These christians only want to use a bible translation that is based on the TR and that pretty much leaves you with the KJV only! In Dutch, we have the 'Statenvertaling' bible translation, which was based on the TR and made in the early 17th century, and here, too, we have people who only want to read that one translation for pretty much the same reasons.

I could never get a good answer from the church leaders that wasn\\'t essentially dogma. Tradition. Here\\'s a theory though, and it holds for much of the history of the Bible. If you lead a group of people and authority comes from a book, the more those people depend on you to interpret that book, the more power you hold. If you can force the adoption of a text that most people cannot understand, then you can essentially tell the people whatever you want to.',\n",
       "    \"A lot of these top level comments don't seem to address a very important issue. Where the translations came from. I went to a Baptist school and this is what we were taught as to why they believed in that. There are two main categories of manuscripts that we have found. (haven't found any originals, but the most complete and oldest manuscript are considered the source as far as translations are concerned.) The two types are the Codex Sinaiticus and the Codex Vaticanus. - The Sinaiticus was found in a monastery on Mt. Saini, only had parts of the old testament, but most or all of the new testament. - Vaticanus was found in the Vatican library and had pretty much the entire New and Old testament. (IIRC the monks/priests in that area took delicate care to preserve the words when they originally hand copied it. So it is without mistakes from the original.) The King James Version was translated word for word from the Vaticsnus, with essentially no interpretation taken by the interpreter. So it is as close as possible to the original. Every other version was translated from the Sinaiticus, or a combination of the two. This is what leads to different phrases, wordings, and versions. Now this is a debated topic even among Christians. We have hundreds of denominations and many different interpretations of the Bible, so there's going to be a lot of dispute. One of the big difference between Conservative Christians (Baptists, Pentscostals) is that they believe that the word should be literally translated with no interpretation by the part of the translator. Contemporary Christians believe that so long as the interpretation doesn't change, the Doctrine doesn't change, and that the spirit of the translation is there, it doesn't matter.\",\n",

There was no agreement of what constituted \"The Bible\" for several hundred years after the supposed life of Christ. Even after there was some agreement, the Bible was only printed in Latin, because the Catholic Church at that time believed the common people were not capable of understanding it for themselves. It was not until the Protestant Reformation in the 1500\\'s or so that there was any major effort to print the Bible in a language other than Latin. My understanding, and I\\'m sure I will be corrected if I\\'m wrong, is the goal of \"versions\" of the bible is to remain as true as possible to the original language of the canonical books, while translations \"interpret\" those books. **EDIT:** I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been more wrong in a comment.',\n",

       "    'I see some important stuff missing from the answers here, although there is a mention of the quality of the language. First of all, the King James Bible is a revision to the Tyndale Bible, which was the very first translation of the bible into English. In addition to the Vulgate, Tyndale used numerous sources including manuscripts older and more authoritative than the Latin Vulgate, which was the only version of the bible authorized by the Roman Catholic Church. Second, this pissed off the Roman Catholic Church for two reasons—one, the scripture and mass were kept in Latin in order to maintain the \"catholic\" nature of the worldwide church (and for elitist reasons too). During the reformation, bibles in native tongues became popular as a way of democratizing Christianity. The establishment of the Church of England made English language bibles the norm. After a few years, many criticisms emerged of existing English versions, which is why mainstream Anglicans and Puritans alike were looking for a better edition. Therefore King James assembled a committee of scholars to undertake a new English translation. This pleased the Puritans because they wanted the word of God without an intermediary, and it pleased the Anglicans because James, as head of the Church of England would be providing them with an *authorized* text. The clergy of an organized church could debate and contemplate ecclesiastical issues and reach some level of consensus more easily. The committee relied on all the extant English versions (particularly Tyndale\\'s) and numerous other texts in their original languages, but apparently few or no ancient manuscripts. Third, tradition. That\\'s been mentioned. And, for the material they had available, as a translation it is Not That Bad. Fourth, the beauty and power of the language. I am agnostic with absolutely no leanings or sympathy towards the religions of Abraham. However, one has to know at least some of the bible in order to more fully appreciate literature and European culture.

The *majority* of existing manuscripts are in agreeance with the Textus Receptus and thus the King James. While other modern versions translate mostly from the Nestle-Aaland Greek text, which also favors the Westcott  &  Hort greek texts. And these texts are based off of the \"minority\" of manuscriptive evidence. They chose rather to translate from the suspected oldest manuscripts in existence (because dating these manuscripts isn\\'t even an exact science). They believe that older = better. But that isn\\'t necessarily true. The older manuscripts could have been manipulated. And the majority of manuscripts were likely not as old because they had been read and read, and copied and copied. It shows signs of great use. Which is a sign that they were much more highly valued.

That is what biblical scholars do, they try to look at the newly discovered information and fix them with new revisions.

For what it was, it actually is pretty decent.) And we don\\'t \"follow\" that specific translation either. We follow the Bible to the best of our understanding of what the authors\\' intents were. We typically rely on Theologians to follow good historical practice in trying to discern what that meaning was. And I don\\'t mean to say there is some special or hidden meaning in the Bible left behind for us modern people. I mean much of that meaning has likely been forgotten due to changes in cultures and languages, and we\\'re just trying to figure out what it meant back then.

The 1611 King James version gathered the most reliable and earliest scrolls that were available at that time and paid the most experienced translators of Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, etc. in London for several years. I own and read several 20th century translations so I am not telling anybody what to do. However, I appreciate the fact that the KJV predates most of the natural sciences and all of the social sciences. Therefore, if the KJV has errors, they aren't because someone literally tried to subtly force them into agreement with post-enlightenment ideas. The Dead Sea scrolls unearthed in 1946 include an even earlier version of Isaiah than the KJV translators had access to...which has further validated their attention to detail and accuracy.\",\n",

       "    'The King James Bible wasn\\'t written 1600 years after Jesus lived, it was *transcribed* from the different languages previous versions of the same book and put into English by the most learned linguistic scholars available to the king of England(not just Englishmen mind you, there were African scholars among them.) Back in the olden times schools weren\\'t a thing, some rich folks had people to teach their kids but most folks didn\\'t and so almost everyone was illiterate, they couldn\\'t read. Because most were poor and nobody had cars, information, like languages, was very expensive to move around and teach people, because of this there were way more languages in a single area than there are today so in order for the early church to spread they couldn\\'t just print out bibles for everyone to read, men had to travel across the land telling people about Jesus and his miracles, often they had to learn this new language then preach the gospel in that language to the people were they were and build a church there, keep a postal correspondence, pen pals. About 60 years after the death and resurrection it struck the leaders of the early church that they should write this down and that it would be easier to have one guy in charge of reading from one book to a bunch of people instead of sending men to places to teach an oral tradition. When they took to writing this book they used the languages which were common and which they knew. The Torah, the old testament, had been finished for hundreds of years by this point and it was written in Hebrew, the new testament had pars in Aramaic, the Jesus\\' first language, an off shoot of Hebrew, Greek as it was a common language after Alexander the great conquered so much of the world, and Latin which was the roman language it was becoming very popular at the time because the roman empire was expanding rapidly and and almost all of the events of the new testament happened within Rome\\'s borders. After a time this early assembly of texts began spreading so far the none of those languages were known to the local population, so the early church decided to put together a Latin only version and to have all the priests and other people who read the book for others learn just that language and this sped up the spread of the religion even faster, it also helped people from all over Europe and north Africa communicate because the upper classes were all learning Latin themselves. There was a problem with this strategy of spreading the bible though, bad men could become book readers and lie about what it said for their own benefit and eventually the heads of the church began doing this. That made other people in the church very upset and so the church began to split up into new sects, one man named Martin Luther was largely responsible for the biggest split when he nailed a list of 95 grievances to the door the Castle Church in Wittenberg. It was out this act and many others that Protestantism was born, and the main labor of early protestants was to translate the bible out of Latin and into their own languages so the people could read and understand the words themselves. advancements in technology and trade had helped standardize languages over longer distances, the printing press had sped up the time it took to make a copy of a book from months and years to a matter of days. As early versions were being written people noticed certain things didn\\'t translate very well and whole orders of monks, friars, vicars and other faithful and well learned men came to translate these books as accurately as possible. The reason we can trust a book that is so old to be accurate is because newer versions of the bible are a relatively new thing. The bible is the best selling and most printed book in world history that means almost every major publisher in the world wants to get in on that market and so many order a new translation to stir up a bit of media interest and to makes sure they hold all the rights to their unique translation, it is a very valid argument to say that the first and second king James versions are the most thoroughly researched versions of the English bible and does it\\'s best to keep to a literal translation which results in certain things being hard to understand without context but it wont oversimplify the translation. It\\'s also worth noting that modern translations have political purposes behind them in some cases. KJV first the have other versions at hand for quick contrast, a scoefield study bible paired with KJV is the best you can do though, it\\'s the difference between knowing that Ham saw his father Noah naked and was cursed and knowing that the phrase\"To see/uncover your father\\'s nakedness\" was an idiom or turn of phrase meant to express that you had slept with one of your father\\'s wives. other versions may simply say Ham got his father drunk and undressed him and was cursed they don\\'t leave the idiom in tact nor do they explain who cursed Ham, it wasn\\'t God, it was Noah.

I skimmed over a few answers and a lot of them were dead on, but here are my thoughts: * 1) Consumers are not knowledgable about the products they buy, and I think it's the absolute worst in technology. The alcohol market comes in a close second. How many people do you know who realistically understand how a computer actually works at the component level? People may not understand what differentiates Intel from AMD, but they sure do understand that 8Gb is a higher number than 4Gb or that i7 is a higher number than i5. * 2) People have been conned (sort of) to believe a processor is the sole determinant of performance. It's a conceptual mindset that has been baked in over time, similar to people in America believing foreign cars are better than vehicles made by GM or Ford. This is far from the case. On the enterprise side, corporations are much smarter and understand the whole picture. The consumer side is much more segmented and much more dependent market action. Look at what is happening with PC sales before the Windows 10 launch. * 3) The chip manufacturers have a lot of leverage. I should really change this to manufacturer because intel runs a near monopoly. To be perfectly honest, I wouldn't be surprised if AMD went bankrupt or got bought out by a chinese company within the next five years. I think the last time I checked, less than 2% of the total volume we purchase is from AMD. * 4) There is a lot of incentive to move product. The processor industry is based on rebates as an incentives to purchase inventory. For instance, if company XYZ (Dell) forecasts to use 10,000 units of processor ABC (2.4Ghz widget) in a given quarter, there is a rebate that is negotiated into that volume. On the memory side, rebates are based at the bit level. OEM manufacturers like Dell or HP aren't stupid, and they will pedal products in order to meet volume based rebates. * 5) This is sort of a follow up to #4, but there is excess that needs to be used. What usually ends up happening is that companies will purchased remaining components that have missed the forecast, and you usually see this with higher end components since it is high dollar value, lower volume part. So going back to #4, let's say I forecast at the corporate level to use 10,000 units in a month but I have only used 5,000 by the 27th day of the month. I will purchase the last 5,000 pieces in order to hit my rebate, and then start using that excess to manufacture computers that have crappier components. All about segmentation and clearing inventory. * 6) Most importantly: markets are segmented based on price points. If a manufacturer created a computer with top end components, that would cost a fortune. We have to slice the pie in order to maximize market share and profit.\",\n",

HW vendors do not pay anywhere near retail cost for the components. Someone mentioned here that they worked for Intel and could get a $300 i7 processor for $70, so what price do you think Dell/HP pay for a i7? Now, they will only put in a graphics card/chip that is low cost. Nvidia are not going to sell them a GTX 980 for ~$50. so they will put in a low cost, low to medium spec graphics processor. Nvidia etc then markets their high cards to the “enthusiasts” So \"skimping\" on the graphics processor has nothing to do with marketing/specs/upgrading the proc or sales pushing the processor over everything else or even how much money Intel provides. Now, Intel provides a shit load of money, and so the processor gets “hero’d” in the Ads. If NVidia provided the same amount of marketing dollars, you would see their logo everywhere. Also, I used to manage that money and Intel never said “We will only give you this money if you stop selling AMD”. Obviously we could only use that money to market Intel based hardware. AMD just didn’t give as much money. So it all comes down to cost',\n",

This way the maker sells the high-end chip (and gets kudos from Intel) and likely gets the return business on smaller margin items like RAM which they mark up for upgrade prices. Now they've sold twice as much ram to a single buyer. Fun fact: back in the dinosaur ages, Intel couldn't keep up with demand so they contracted AMD to make chips for them. Once Intel could handle demand they found they couldn't end their contract because of legal loopholes and AMD taking these loopholes to court. AMD and Intel chips were literally interchangeable for many, many years. Only when the court finally cut AMD off did they start relying on their own independent product lines.

Without the Registry, your domain wouldn\\'t \"exist\". ICANN: A non-profit (*COUGH*NEW GTLDs*COUGH*) organization who policies which company runs which Registry (above). Usually lots of money and bidding to gain control of one. They spell out the general policy all Registry and Registrars must follow with respect to the domain industry.

IPv4 first, to be more pedantic, nowadays a mix of IPv4 and newer/longer IPv6, when it became clear that us humans are getting too many devices connected to the network and run out of IPv4 addresses. IP data packets are passed between hosts, sometimes through a chain of intermediary routers (the \"gateways\" of those connected smaller networks) using IP addresses as identifiers. A domain name is different. A domain name is a human readable string, since humans aren\\'t very good at remembering numbers (IP addresses). A whole infrastructure is needed to maintain the mappings between IP addresses and domain names. Keeping that infrastructure working costs money. Technically, the domain name is usually optional. You can run most services by sharing just the IP address (and port number, if you run a common service on a non-standard port, but port numbers are entirely another story) so others would know where to connect to.',\n",

When you go to a website, you actually are copying a file from a computer (server) somewhere else and loading it on your computer to view it. Most people seem to think their computer is more like a window, showing other locations, but your machine is more or less copying the blueprints for the site and then building the page in your house. Domains are just human friendly ways of navigating to all of the locations around the world. If we didn't have domains, remembering websites would be like remembering phone numbers. The web address of any site is a numerical address separated by periods. If everyone remembers your ip, you can have a page without having a domain at all!\",\n",

Since then Network Solutions was acquired by Verisign, so the money you are paying, minus whoever your registrars cut is, goes to them.

Technically, your domain is actually a subdomain, but we don\\'t call it that because you can make your domain name have a subdomain, so it would be a sub-subdomain.

So the country loses less money paying for exports, and makes more money selling its now cheaper exports. They can also create new money to pay for government spending, creating employment and pulling the country back onto its feet. If there is only one currency, a country can't do this.

Imagine if you were a country with serious debts and a lagging manufacturing economy. It would really help to devalue your currency some. It makes your debts less valuable, and makes your manufactured goods cheaper for buyers. Now imagine you're in a currency union with a bunch of more economically successful countries and they don't want to devalue the currency. They want the currency strong, and tell you to pound sand.

       "    'TIG welding works something like this: You have a tungsten spike that is hooked up to the welder (the machine, not the person) and has a handle attached to it. Tungsten is used because it has an *extremely* high melting point. You also have a big metal clamp that you attach somewhere on the thing you\\'re welding; it also goes to the welder. The welder then tries to push a lot of current through that circuit: welder-- > tungsten-- > part-- > clamp-- > welder. Everything in that circuit is a very good conductor of electricity *except* the small gap between the tungsten and the part. Thus, that gap gets extremely hot. So hot, in fact, that it can melt steel. Melting the steel (or other metal, but steel is popular) is only part of the challenge. Once you have the steel melted on both of the sides of the weld you usually need to add just a little bit more material to fill whatever small gap is present, or to fill in a corner to have a small rounded area (a \"fillet\"). For this you hold a piece of steel wire in the other hand and you feed it in or dab it as needed, to build up an appropriate puddle of steel that you\\'re working with as you move along the weld. While you\\'re doing all of this the metal is incredibly hot and therefore quite willing to start reacting with the oxygen in the air. In order to keep this from happening the whole process is covered with a layer of inert gas (Argon, typically). This is dispensed from the same thing that is holding the tungsten spike. The whole process is typically controlled through a pedal, much like the throttle on a car or sewing machine. Properly TIG welding requires you to coordinate the power with your foot, the heat with your dominant hand, and the fill rod with your non-dominant hand. Once you\\'re coordinated enough to handle all of these at once, though, you can make really really pretty and strong welds with incredible finesse.',\n",

Second, tungsten is the electrode used to direct the current (used for its high melting point). It is not a gas, the inert gas is either argon or helium. We use the gas to keep the metal away from the oxygenated and humidified air. The arc creates heat close to 10,000 degrees and the metal will readily oxidize (rust). Oxidized metal is very brittle and therefore not ideal if you want 2 things to stay stuck together. It also stabilizes the arc as the atmosphere will disrupt it, and TIG welding is a *very* precise process. The gas is inert for exactly that reason...If the gas was able to react, you would end up with a material that is much weaker than your base metal. In general, a weld has around 60,000psi tensile strength, introducing other components into the liquid puddle would displace the welding rod used to fill the gap. Also, side note. Inert gases do not *readily* react...you can still bond them to atoms under extreme conditions...but not for very long.\",\n",

Awareness is about knowing and recognizing the signs in yourself and others, so that the disease can be detected early, and thus be more easily treated. For example, I bet most people who have heard of breast cancer haven't heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It's a rare form of breast cancer that forms in sheets instead of lumps. By the time it's detectable as a misshapen breast, is usually already at stage 4. Another example is that men can and do get breast cancer. Most men don't realize this, and would have absolutely no idea how to monitor for it. That's another part of awareness: knowing who is at risk. Most people only know that lumps = breast cancer. But there are many kinds that manifest in different ways. Awareness helps (or should) people understand more about the disease, not just make them aware that it exists. This should be the case for most cancers, but breast cancer gained traction due to its prevalence in modern America, and organizations like SGK getting the word out. P.S. Try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when talking about breast cancer awareness. There are shady people trying to profit off it, sure, but there are also a lot of people out there who this cause is very important to, and are trying to help with nothing but the best intentions.

We've already hosted a few fundraisers whose proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. There are people out there trying to help. I'm one of them.

It's true there are many parasitic organizations that capitalize on our charity and good will, but the fact is that breast cancer is one of the many cancers where death is preventable if caught in early stages. This is alongside cervical (get your pap smears at 21 ladies, and HPV vaccines for everyone), prostate for men (older men should do digital rectal exams), and of course lung (stop smoking). It's a little unfair to say that breast cancer is the only one getting awareness when all these other cancers are also getting attention. I think breast cancer was the first big movement because you are able to do a self-exam and that is empowering to women, so it is now the biggest (btw the main reliable screening tool is regular mammographies, so self-exams are a start, but not sufficient). Just to provide a scale of the problem, more than 50% (a half!) of women will develop a benign breast lesion. Fortunately most of these are not lethal and should not progress to a malignancy. More than 10% of women will develop a true malignancy, where your odds of survival are almost exponential the earlier you catch it. So it's kind of important to make it common knowledge how to find a lump in your breast, because there's a chance that it might kill you. That's not to deny the aforementioned parasitic organizations.

As you might be aware, most non-profit organizations have to divide their resources between administration and their cause. What you might not be aware of is that a lot of the administrative costs go toward finding more funding. Unless a non-profit has a stable stream of income from committed donors, grants, or an endowment, every non-profit is in constant pursuit of more sources of revenue. This often means hiring a professional grant writer and hosting some sort of open house or gala that informs and solicits donors. Even stable non-profits will probably be constantly pursuing more revenue to further their cause and expand their programs. The Komen Foundation decided to try a for-profit marketing campaign in order to get revenue. The people they hired advised them to have an ambitious advertising campaign with the justification that it would bring in a lot more revenue than it cost. It cost a ton of money but it was wildly successful, so they have kept it up and followed those strategies.

       "    \"Singles are generally used as a way of promoting an album, before and after the release of said album. These days it's fairly normal to release one, two, or sometimes even three singles prior to an album's release date, in order to generate a bit of hype. The first single usually comes out a month or so before. The song gets played on the radio, YouTube etc., and people start downloading it. Chart success, word of mouth or plain old plugging gets the hype train rolling. Then the second single is released either a week before the album or sometimes simultaneously with the album, and people who enjoy the song will hopefully then go and purchase the album right away. It's not uncommon for the single released in unison with the album to be the most radio-friendly/commercial, in order to generate the most buzz possible for the album and attract listeners from outside the artist's usual fanbase. Subsequent singles released after the album make extra money and serve to keep the album in the public eye - if the record label keeps the artist on the radio with fresh new songs, the label can continue to promote the album even if the artist is busy touring. Sometimes, the initial response to an album can be disappointing in terms of sales, but a strong third or fourth single can be a great boost. Consider the example of *Wonderwall* from Oasis' second album *(What's the Story) Morning Glory?*. *Wonderwall* was the third single, released 4 weeks after the album. The album did not sell well outside the UK initially but after the release of *Wonderwall*, a chart topper in several countries, the album became an international success. If the artist has not yet released an album, the record label will sometimes use a single as a way to gauge the public's response to said artist and decide whether or not to record an album with them. Artists will occasionally release non-album singles, songs that are not meant to promote their album and don't appear on the tracklisting. This can be for a number of reasons, including: to keep the band on the radio while they are between albums, to give something extra to the fans, if the song was featured on a film's soundtrack album, or simply because the artist feels like it.

They are basically sorting the album out for you, noting that the single is the hit, or best song on the album. If a listener likes the single, they might check out the whole album and give the more experimental, or less popular songs a chance, rather than finding the experimental or not as radio friendly songs first and writing off the artist.

So an vinyl record with one song per side, was pretty good for the radio business. Well, record labels have always been about money. When they realized that they could sell singles, they sold them.

A couple of years back a ton of naked pictures of celebreties was stolen off of iCloud, this hack was done because of social engineering (figuring out their login) and weak passwords (using brute force to gain access). If your password is a word or simple, it will take fewer guesses. If a hacker knows your login and wants to get *your* password, they will usually start with a dictionary attack (lists of common word and combinations); by requiring your password to be at least 8 characters with numbers, the amount of guesses needed goes way way up - if you have 4 characters and numbers it's 4^37, if you have 8 it's 8^37 (not counting symbols etc), that's hours vs. billions of years of computing. Now when a breach happens, complex passwords are still your friend *if* the website did their homework. *A lot* of people use the same username and password on all their accounts; facebook, linkedin, twitter, pornhub etc. and this is where complexity starts to matter. They now have most of your credentials, they know what email you sign in with and they know the hash of your password for *this* website. Now most website worth their salt will have a custom way of salting their passwords, however the hacker just gained access to everything, which probably includes the source code for the login, they can now start to figure out your password, which probably gains login to everything.

Ok so breakdown on how passwords are stored: If whoever is storing the password for your account isn\\'t a toolbag, they don\\'t ever actually store your password. Instead they feed your password to a hash function and then store what that outputs, and then whenever you input your password, they just feed it back through the function again and check to see if it matches what they have stored. May need to explain what a hash function is so let\\'s detour for a minute. A hash function will take some input of any length and it will output something of a fixed length (usually quite long), the input should always map to exactly the same output ever time and it should do so in a way that\\'s quite easy to do, but very very very hard to undo. For example: using the md5 hash (which isn\\'t one that should ever be used for storing passwords) feeding it \"password\" outputs 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99, \"password1235483\" outputs c048f211d0c6e9dcd83316b042a6723c and and mashing on my keyboard for a hundered chracters or so produces bae019d234e18408edd8b82c9437fecf So this means that if a site is compromised and someone makes off with whatever database they\\'re storing the hashed passwords in, they\\'d stuck trying figure out what the hell the hashed passwords are. In general this is accomplished via a lookup table which looks kinda like this 286755fad04869ca523320acce0dc6a4=password 10b222970537b97919db36ec757370d2=password1 7576f3a00f6de47b0c72c5baf2d505b0=password123 f2c93f0625019e5461379cd1a4ed1b16=p455w0rd and so on. Then you compare the hashed passwords that were stolen with the known ones and see what matches. Infact because computers are good at what they do, you can just find the hash for basically every combination of characters under a certain size. there\\'s only a few billion passwords with 6 characters or fewer, and it would not take a computer very long to build a database of the hashes for every single one of those passwords. And it also doesn\\'t take a computer very long to check the a bunch of stolen passwords against that list. If you have a weak password, they\\'re going to find it real quick. If you\\'ve something much longer and more complex, then it\\'s probably not sitting in some lookup table. Infact, hashing in general isn\\'t the only thing that happens to a password. Instead what they really really should be doing is a salt+hash method. which means instead of feeding just your password to the hash function, they feed it and some other randomly generated \"password\" (the salt) to it. In a simple case this could be something like yourpassword64sdf55c4c1w34372654263r4236r623r23r423564415... where yourpassword is what it says it is and then the random stuff afterwards is the salt. Done right this has two advantages. The first is if two people use the same password there will be different salts used and so the hashed passwords will be different. The second is that it makes lookup tables much less useful, and forces anyone wanting to figure the password out to fall back on brute force guessing.

       "    \"This is because the hacks are, in every sense of the word, guessing. Hackers just leverage computers to intelligently 'guess' hundreds to thousands of passwords a second. This is simplifying the various methods of cracking a password, but the bottom line is that computers are much better at guessing passwords than humans and complex passwords are required to increase the entropy of your password. A 4 digit PIN with composed of the numbers 0 through 9 has 10,000 possible combinations. All 10,000 of those combinations can be tested with software in basically an instant. A 4 digit PIN that could use the English alphabet, numbers and special characters, let's just say it's 50 different symbols, has 6.25 million possible combinations. That increase in uncertainty (entropy) makes it much more difficult for hackers to use simple exploitation tools to discover your password. Now you just need to scale the previous example up to allow for 20+ characters, or whatever the site allows you to use. However, just because a site requires you use special characters, symbols and capital letters does not mean you are safe. As other posters have mentioned, hackers keep 'rainbow tables' of hashed passwords - basically a list of common, encrypted passwords that hackers can compare to the encrypted passwords they are trying to decipher. So, if your password is PAssword!!11, you are basically already compromised. A much better solution is to use a password manager like LastPass to automatically generate high-entropy passwords that you don't have to remember. It works between all of your devices and, as long as you create a strong master password, keeps your new passwords protected by encryption. This works because hackers tend to go after the easy targets, that is, they run a preformatted 'list' of common hashed passwords against their target, exploit the least defended victims, and move on.

       "    '\"** Part One : Stocks ** First, let\\'s imagine that down the street there is a toy store. Mr. Jones owns the toy store, and he has owned it for the last ten years. The toy store is a company which sells toys and all the kids love to get toys from Mr. Jones\\' toy store. Let\\'s suppose we wanted to buy Mr. Jones\\' toy store from him so that all of the kids would buy toys from us instead. Would we be able to buy it for a dollar? No, of course not. It is worth a lot more than that. How about ten dollars? A hundred dollars? Well, how exactly would we find out how much we need to pay in order to buy Mr. Jones\\' toy store? The most important thing to consider is simply how much money is the toy store making. If the toy store is making $100 every day, that means it is making roughly $3,000 (30 days of $100) every month, or $36,000 every year (12 months of $3,000). Let\\'s suppose we are able to figure that the toy store should be able to keep making this much for the next ten years. Then we could consider that the entire toy store is worth $360,000 (which is $36,000 for ten years). Now, in practice this is a lot more complicated. But the basic principle is simply to figure out how much money a company can be expected to make in a certain time frame. Fortunately, we don\\'t have to figure it out ourselves. There are big companies whose job is to figure out how much other companies are worth, and they do all of the hard work for us. They will tell us just how much Mr. Jones\\' toy store is really worth, and then we can decide to buy it or not. So, let\\'s consider that the toy store is worth $360,000. If we want to buy it (and if he is willing to sell it), we can pay Mr. Jones that much money and now the toy store is ours! Now, this is all well and good if we have $360,000 and we want to own the entire company. But let\\'s suppose we only have half that much, we have $180,000. What can we do now? Well, as long as Mr. Jones is willing, we can buy half of his company instead of the whole thing. This means that we will own 50% or half of the company, and he will own the other half. That means that instead of all of the money from selling toys going to Mr. Jones, half will go to him and the other half to us. Another way of saying that we own 50% of the company is to say that we own 50% of the stock in a company. When a company is set up in a way that you can buy pieces of it, those pieces are called stock. There are two ways to think about stock: percentages, and shares. What we just talked about are percentages. We can buy 50% of the shares in Mr. Jones\\' toy company for $180,000. Similarly, we could buy 10% of the shares in Mr. Jones\\' toy company for $36,000 (assuming the total value of the company was $360,000), or we could buy 1% of the shares for $3,600, and so on. When you hear people talk about stocks, you will hear them talk about shares of stock. What exactly does this mean? Well, let\\'s imagine that Mr. Jones has a lot of people who want to buy a piece of his company. What he can do is say \"Hey everyone, I have 100 different pieces of my company for sale.\" In this example, there are 100 total pieces he has for sale, each one being worth 1% of the stock. To buy all 100 pieces would cost you $360,000 and this would mean you own the entire company. This would mean that whenever the company makes money, you get all of the money. But let\\'s suppose we only have $3,600 to use. This means all we can afford is one piece of his company, but that one piece is worth 1% which means that every time the company makes a hundred dollars, we will get one dollar. So in this example, Mr. Jones\\' looks at the situation and realizes it is very hard to find people to buy pieces of his company, because each piece costs $3,600 which is a lot of money. So he decides rather than just have 100 pieces, or shares, he is going to have a thousand pieces! Now it takes ten shares to have 1% of the company, but each share is only $360. That is a lot more affordable. He could even decide to make 10,000 shares which means that you could buy a share for only $36. So this is the basic concept. Companies cut their value into pieces, or shares, and then sell the shares to people who will buy them. The people who buy shares are called \"investors\" and the act of buying a share is called \"investing\". This means that they are buying shares in a company because they think that eventually they will make back more than what they paid, because they are getting a piece of all of the money that the company makes. When a company is enormous, worth billions of dollars, even a thousand shares is simply not enough. They need to have many, many shares in order to make sure that shares are affordable. Some companies have millions of shares of stock. Now, we have covered one aspect of what it means to own stock in a company. You are able to keep some of the money the company makes, based on how many shares you own. But when you own part of a company, you don\\'t just get some of the money it makes. You also get to make decisions. Everyone who has shares in a company has the right to vote for what the company will do next. The amount of voting power you have is equal to the percentage of shares you have. Imagine that a company is owned by three people: Billy, Melissa, and James. Imagine that Billy owns 40% of the total shares, and that Melissa and James each own 30%, which is less than what Billy owns. Let\\'s suppose that the toy company is trying to decide whether to sell a certain toy. Billy thinks it is a good idea, but Melissa and James think it is a bad idea. Well, even though Billy has more shares of stock in the company, and more voting power, he will still be out voted by both Melissa and James. This is because together Melissa and James have 60% compared to Billy\\'s 40%. When a company has a lot of share holders (people who own stock in the company), they will have meetings called shareholder meetings. In these meetings, everyone gets to vote based on the shares they own. The company will do whatever the prevailing vote decides. So then, this brings up a question. What if there are a lot of people who own shares, but one of them owns more than half of all the shares? Would that person be able to out-vote everyone else, no matter how many other people there are? The answer is yes. If a single person owns more than half of all the shares, then they have what is called \"controlling interest\" in the company. This means that they can decide anything for the company and outvote everyone else. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------',\n",

Why should I spend 40 hours a week shovelling dog shit, and get the same amount of reward/food as you get to be a chocolate taster? Why should I spend 8 years training to be a doctor, while you only spend 18 months learning to be a chef? More importantly, why would anyone do the hard/rubbish jobs, if they could do an easier/more pleasant job and still get the same house etc as everyone else? Some people would be willing to, for the sake of society, but many would not At it\\'s most simple, communism is too fair. It would work very well if we could truly split the work that needed to be done, and the rewards into equal chunks that everyone did the same. If we all spent a day as a doctor, a day as the shit shoveller, a day as the chocolate taster, and then had a day sat on the sofa with the iPad, we might all think it was fair and be happy. In reality, we can\\'t make things this neat so some people (usually the ones with the most highly required skills that we can\\'t do without) will dislike the system. Similarly it\\'s open to abuse since lazy people can just slack off and let others do the work Socialism - Does work to a far greater extent. Most of Europe, for example, is far more socialistic than the US or many other parts of the world. When taken to the same extent as communism (ie traditional socialism), it fails for the same reason as communism: it can\\'t be fair enough. Note that this is traditional socialism, however, where things like manufacturing are all under the control of the state, prices are controlled etc. There is an alternative which does seem to work better: Modern Socialism. Modern Socialism, is a kind of fairer-fairness. Instead of everyone putting in the same and taking out the same, it\\'s kind of weighted. You still get rewarded more if you have greater skills or put in greater effort, but some things that are seen as belonging to everyone, are paid for by everyone. Think of it more as a \"We all contribute some of our income, we all gain from the shared result\" rather than \"we put everything in and all get the exact same out\". For example energy companies, transportation, health services: these are things that everyone needs and uses, so the idea is that everyone pays into them and everyone can use them fairly.... but Doctors still get paid more than chocolate tasters, so there\\'s a reason to aspire to \"better\" or harder jobs, or to work at jobs which take more effort or are less pleasant but give more financial rewards. You can still gain personally *as well as* sharing services with others. This is generally more appealing and is *fairer* if not *more equal*. The NHS (British National Health Service) is a great example of socialism \"working\" - everyone pays in with their taxes, and everyone can use the NHS for free. You pay in a little more if you earn more, but you are still allowed to earn more (ie a Doctor isn\\'t told he has to be paid the same as a street cleaner) Capitalism - Capitalism doesn\\'t necessarily \"work\" any better than Socialism or Communism... it just happens to be that Capitalism works in favour of people who already have power/money, so the people with power/money work to keep it that way. The \"true\" answer is probably somewhere closer to Norway/Sweden/Denmark, where people are able to earn more money and free markets work for \"commodities\" (eg luxuries), but \"services\" are more tightly controlled and shared.',\n",
       "    'A lot of these answers use the word \"greedy\". It\\'s not so much about people being \"greedy\", but more about people being \"lazy\", or \"valuing their own labor\", depending on how you look at it. The fact is, people are unlikely to work hard unless they are rewarded for their work, and Communism is very bad at rewarding hard work. In other words - Supply and Demand Vs Command Economy Capitalism uses the supply and demand model, which means people are free to produce what they want, whenever they want, and to charge however much they want. Since people can charge whatever they want, if they are successful, they get rewarded with more money for working harder or smarter. Communism uses the command economy model, where the government tells people what and how much to produce. There is no real reward for doing anything apart from meeting the targets set by the government. Imagine that you live in a country with 50,000 farmers, all of whom need a shovel. Let\\'s imagine that a shovel lasts 10 years, so we need 5,000 shovels per year. Now let\\'s imagine that one year there is a bad frost, so a lot of farmers end up breaking newer shovels. Now we need 10,000 shovels or 10% of our farmers cannot grow crops. In a supply and demand economy, the shovel factory manager will realize that lots of extra farmers want shovels, and if he makes more shovels, he will make more money, so he will do everything he can to make the extra 5,000 shovels. Prices may rise, but most of the 10,000 farmers who need shovels will get one and continue producing food, even if it becomes more expensive. In a command economy, the chief-comrade of the shovel factory was told by the government to produce 5,000 shovels that year. If more farmers want shovels, that\\'s not his problem - he already met his quota, he will get no more reward. The only thing that will get him making more shovels is if a Party Officer comes down and threatens him. There is no chance of the chief-comrade receiving material rewards as this is an egalitarian workers paradise, where doctors drive the same cars as street sweepers. In the mean-time, 5,000 farmers can\\'t produce food because they don\\'t have shovels. But let\\'s say, shovels need handles and blades (also known as supply chain). In the supply and demand system, the factory manager can go to the handle factory and the blade factory, and ask them to double production to meet his demands, rewarding them with more money. He can then get another 5,000 handles  &  another 5,000 blades, and make 5,000 more shovels. Again, prices may rise, but everyone is working hard to make the necessary 10,000 shovels since they will all make more money. In a command economy, the handle factory chief-comrade and the blade factory chief-comrade have are in the same position as the shovel factory chief-comrade before central government threatened him - they have met their quotas already, they don\\'t care if some farmers have broken shovels. As they have no reward for doing extra work, they are only going to make the extra 5,000 handles and the extra 5,000 blades that the shovel chief-comrade needs if the political officer comes down and \"persuades\" them. In the mean-time, the shovel factory isn\\'t making shovels, and the farmers aren\\'t farming. Now apply the supply chain needed for a shovel to a tractor, and you can see why communism doesn\\'t work. TL;DR Capitalism relies on people individually deciding what other people need to be produced, and people rewarding each other with money for producing the things we need. Communism relies on central government telling people what to produce, and then someone going down and threatening people if they get it wrong. Local carrots work better than distant sticks.',\n",
       "    \"One could make a strong case that individual families are communist. Everyone contributes what they can, and everyone receives what they need. One this scale, communism and socialism work just fine, and are implemented in almost every house in every country. The problem is that nations are not just big families. Nationalism can create bonds between people, but it is not the same as familial bonds. As such, the inherent parasitism which is fundamental to family structure becomes a problem on the national level. Also, grown adults who require services do not like being treated like children and demand autonomy. Last, individual families do not have to do everything, there exist outside institutions (other families, businesses, etc.) to fulfill unmet needs. Nations tend to be self-sufficient and cannot just let entire domains of needs be left to outside parties. In short, socialism and communism work great when the group involved is tightly knit (family, small local sports team, small business, etc.) A reasonable real-world example of something a little bigger scale might be the Kibbutz system in Israel. However, as the size of the group increases and trust and dependency between individuals decreases these systems can start to break down. Once you reach the size of entire countries, these systems flaws become highly transparent. Just as a quick example: consider a parent refusing to pay the doctor for their child's visit and a parent forcing their child to go to the doctor vs. a rich person being forced to pay for a poorer individuals care and/or a rich person forcing a poorer person to go to the doctor when they don't want to.\",\n",

       "    'Your question is harder to answer than you would think. - There are many definitions of socialism and communism. - \"Great in theory\" depends on your political values. - Actual implementation is debatable and its success depends on what you would consider favorable. - People will give you their thoughts on both systems, but you should be wary that it is an extremely politically charged question. **Many definitions**: They come with more varieties than a Japanese Kit-Kat collection and they are often contradictory. They have been reformulated as many times as it was politically profitable. For example, many here cite Marx as the basis, but if you were to read him, you would find him opposed to other communists thinkers that followed him. So let\\'s try very basic definitions. Communism: A governing system where workers are owners of the means of production and actual production. Socialism: A governing system where capitalistic actors are allowed to operate, but wages and capital are heavily taxed and wealth is redistributed to the poorest. **\"Great in theory\"** Let\\'s clear socialism first. In theory and in practice, you would find it similar to what you know in your country (I\\'m assuming you\\'re from an industrialized country cuz this is Reddit). The main difference would be on your paycheck: a very high wage tax (or a capital tax if you are more well off and trading equities). Government would be involved in a lot of daily life affairs through regulations or public enterprises and would be politically expected to do so. Democracy can be the form of government, but it is not necessary the case. Communism is more difficult to pin down due to the multiple takes on it as I described before. Historically, it was tried with a centrally organized economy and it was tried with letting some form of capitalism survive within. But the theoretical goal is to make the workers the owners of what they make. Old-stock communists see the factory owner as an opportunist who steal the workers \"added-value\" in the products they make. This comes from Marx\\'s views that value comes from labor only and capital and risk are not factors of growth. This, by the way, is thoroughly wrong in the modern economic theory (irregardless of your political stance). More contemporary communists (a rare sight) make a more humanist appeal, saying income gap or capitalism\\'s inefficient waste management are grotesques, for example. Democracy should, in theory, be the goal of communism since it is supposed the promote the worker\\'s power, but... **Implementation** ... it failed to appear in all attempts so far. While communism achieved industrialization in most countries, it generated terribly despotic regimes. In Benjamin Moore\\'s *The Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy*, Moore hypothesized that communist regimes form when the aristocrats ally themselves to the people to squash bourgeois ambitions. In other words, the movement might start as a popular revolution but will be hijacked by the elites to perpetuate their power. The workers are supposed to govern their workplace and enjoy the best conditions, but they are often treated like lemons to be squeezed. Socialism\\'s successes and failures are more subtle. Scandinavian countries enjoyed both growth and fair redistribution of wealth for years, but they had (and still have) complications. Wage taxes reached highs of 70% at one point in Sweden. At this stage, people start to think what\\'s the point of even showing up for work. Public businesses often operate as monopolies which give a rise in prices and lower the number of choices. It\\'s harder to start a business or save money and all of the potential success depends on the efficiency of the government. Some African countries learned this the hard way when they got their independence and corruption just siphoned the money away. The upside can be great healthcare, education system, solid infrastructure and a wide social net. Modern liberal democracies do try to balance some of those goals and the individual\\'s aspirations to a better life. **Politically charged question** This is Reddit. The average user is American, male, white and in his 30s. Americans usually don\\'t like extremes in politics and give the individual a place of choice when thinking about society. Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not against that. But you won\\'t find a lot of persons here advocating a violent overthrow of the government in favor a subjugation of the people to common ideals. See the other comments in this thread that don\\'t dismiss communism outright: they are downvoted and objected to. I made this one in hopes that it is more explicative and neutral, but as I said, I\\'m not socialist either. Read what you see here with that in mind if you want a critical view of those theories.',\n",
       "    'The conecpt of equality in chances and welfare for everyone is something that fascinates us about socialism. Imagine all the welfare equally distributed in industrial nations, everyone could life a wealthy live, or so is the assumption. Now the problem is about incentives. The amount of welfare generated today is due to the incentives people have to create it. In a free market you generally get more money if you contribute more. So, in order to live a wealthy life, you are incentivized strongly to contribute. In planned economy these incentives are missing, because if everybody is to be compensated equally, nobody is incentivized to work as hard as he would have to in a free market. The sum of these missing incentives empirically led to a significantly lower overall welfare in planned economies. Let me give you an example. Imagine you are a cab driver in a free market. To earn the money you need to survive and acquire wealth you have maximize the money you can get by taking as many passengers as possible and driving them on as long detours as possible, if they do not notice at least, so you earn the maximum amount of money. So the result is: You have an incentive of being a productive cab driver in a free market, but sometimes you may deceive people to earn more money, though they also have an incentive to notice detours and prevent them since it is also their money they spend. Now next is an actual example of what cab drivers did in Moscow, while communism was still active. Since they got paid their salary independent on how many passengers they took in, they were just hiding their cabs well, so they did not have to take passengers. This is an example of missing incentives. Now the government saw the problem and provided incentives by paying cab drivers per mile they drove. Guess what happened, on the highway around Moscow you suddenly saw a huge amount of cabs without passengers driving circles, to reach the miles so they got their full wage. So in result even if you are aware of the problem of incentives it can be very hard or even impossible to figure out incentives for behaviour which contributes to the biggest possible welfare. In capitalism some early theories recognized the \"hidden hand\", which even if people maximize and deceive for their own welfare, in sum leads to everyone profiting from a very huge overall welfare. This phenomena is also well described in the famous Fable of the Bees:  URL_0 ',\n",

Humans are unique in a lot of behaviors that seem to do nothing but indicate our emotional state, like blushing when embarrassed, crying, etc. Seeing this stuff activates empathy in the human brain. Weirdly, sociopaths are able to do terrible things because that brain connection is stunted or not there. They can look at human suffering and it doesn't trigger an emotional response.\",\n",

Full-time positions are significantly more expensive for companies, as once you cross a certain threshold of hours the benefits you need to offer your employees increases. (Exactly what depends on the state.) Thus, a company may be able to save money by juggling several part-time people to meet their needs rather than employing one full time. This often puts employees in a position they're not fans of since it'll often mean they're working the equivalent of a full time load (at multiple employers), but not getting benefits like health insurance from any company.\",\n",
       "    \"Companies incur more costs hiring full-time workers. They must pay for benefits, sick time, vacation, etc. These are things not mandated for part-time workers. So a company can hire 100 part time workers instead of 20 full time workers, pay them the same hourly wage but give them less hours and the overall out-of-pocket cost to the company is much lower. They also have to worry about covering shifts and people quitting less because there's a bigger supply of people on the schedule.\",\n",

       "    \"There's a finite number of hours most jobs will offer to an employee. In some cases, there just isn't enough work to go around to maintain one employee for more than 30 or 40 hours, depending on the job. From another angle, employers in the US are required to pay overtime rates if an hourly employee (and some salaried employees in certain contexts) works more than 40 hours in a week, or either 8 or 12 hours in one day (I forget which at the moment). Say one employee worked 80 hours in a week. The law requires that additional hours after 40 get paid time-and-a-half, so the extra 40 hours is paid as though it were 60 hours. This single worker is getting paid for 100 hours of wages for 80 hours of work. Instead, the employer keeps their costs down - both in terms of labor and costs of operating the building (someone working 80 hours is going to be doing overnight shifts) - by hiring a second employee to work side-by-side. Now they're down to paying 80 hours of wages for 80 hours of work. There are also laws in some cases where certain benefits are required to be granted to an employee who works more than a certain number of hours per week. These benefits cost money for the company to offer. If the company doesn't want to incur *that* cost, they may hire more workers and reduce hours to just below that threshold. Again, that's a cost savings to the employer, but it reduces the income that worker can take home from that one job. --- Simply put, most companies just can't offer more hours to their workers. So, low-income workers take more than one job so they can work more hours and take home more income.\",\n",

Most of your billion dollars is actually something you own which is worth a billion dollars. Property, stock, mutual funds, etc. The way taxes work in the US, you don't pay taxes on what you own. You pay taxes on your income. That income could be from salary, or from a profitable investment. But investments are special, because there is no income until you sell them for more money than you initially paid for them. So let's say you own a billion dollars worth of mutual funds. Over the course of the year, it grows 8% in value. That is an 80 million dollar increase in value. But unless you sell some of it, there is no income, so there is no tax. You are 80 million dollars richer, but you have paid no taxes. Now, hang on a second. You do need some money to live on. Let's say a million dollars this year - that should be enough. So you sell a million dollars worth of this mutual fund you own. You will have to pay taxes on this. But not on a million dollars, just on the difference between what you paid for it and what you sold it for. Let's say the difference is 20% since you initially bought it a few years ago. You will pay taxes on $200k. Also, because this is a special kind of income called capital gains, you will pay a lower tax rate than if it were your salary. Instead of 30% or more, you will pay 20%. $40k. So, you are 80 million dollars richer this year. Your tax bill is $40 thousand dollars.

Currently, long-term capital gains (assets held for more than a year) are taxed at a flat 15% for most income tax brackets. And the kicker here is that if your income is actually in the lowest two brackets of 10% and 15%, you aren't taxed on those long-term capital gains.

       "  'output': {'2225073': [\"I have eczema and my husband is a dermatologist. I have made him explain eczema to me multiple times. This is what I have learned. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a skin barrier function problem. The skin is supposed to keep stuff out- think of a slice of cheddar cheese. People withe eczema are born with skin like Swiss cheese. Stuff gets in more easily and moisture gets out more easily than normal skin. Because things get into the skin, the immune system responds to them as foreign objects- you get inflammation that makes you itch. You scratch the itchy spot and you get more skin breakdown from the trauma. Often the eczema patches are areas of friction- elbows and knees. Eczema treatments revolve around moisturizing to add a layer of protection from allergens getting in. Or topical steroids that decrease inflammation. I get UVB phototherapy. It kills immune system cells (lymphocytes) in the skin surface. The allergens still get into my skin but I have less lymphocytes to catch the allergens and cause inflammation which decreases the amount of itching that I have. The only way to permanently cure eczema would be to permanently improve skin barrier function. Since it is a genetic problem, some researchers are working on gene therapy trials that would change the skin cells to work correctly. The reason many childhood eczema sufferers improve is that skin naturally thickens as you become an adult and it overwhelms the problem. Some people aren't so lucky. Also, people with eczema are more likely to have asthma (allergens get into the skin first and you develop an immune sensitization to the allergen. When you breathe in the same allergen your body sees it as something to fight so you get inflammation and bronchorestriction in the lungs - this is asthma). If you could fix the skin at birth, you would not get the allergens getting into the skin. There would be no inflammation and no itch. We can't do that yet do we target inflammation with immune suppressing drugs like tacrolimus or topical steroids. Moisturizer helps too by improving skin barrier. Right now I have eczema on my eyelids (thin skin), left wrist (friction from watch), hands (loss of natural oils from washing my hands all of the time), both inner elbows and back of knees (areas of friction) and armpits (from clothes rubbing against my skin).\",\n",
       "    \"The tendency to have eczema goes along with a tendency to have allergies and asthma as well. If you don't have all three of the triad, you're lucky. Eczema tends run in families and is likely to come and go throughout your lifetime. During early childhood, the rashes show up often on the insides of the elbows and the back of the knees. They can be on the neck as well. They may return later and affect a different part of the body. Hands and feet are another common location for rashes. I was told that it is actually a dry skin condition, so moisturizing with good stuff like Eucerin and Cetafil lotion can help. In my experience, I stopped having eczema symptoms after my mid 20s. They problem was terrible with my fingers during my time in food service age 18-20, but later, it went away and I haven't been bothered by it for many years. I have severe allergies though that have gotten worse over the years including bouts of angioedema (swelling).\",\n",

If we as a nation are really tired of all the crap that we deal with from politicians then we could organize nationally, form a new party and block vote for these specific people / our nominees. And then slowly change the system. This however has its problems, 1. The US has abysmal voting rates, our populace just isn't interested in politics. We've made a system that we have to use, that no one wants to interact with because it has become so vile and impenetrable. The system is convoluted and fundamentally rotten. Your average american either, A) doesn't have time to wrap their head around everything they feel like they need to know or B) Doesn't want to know because they think it all sucks. 2. The system uses first past the post voting / one person one vote [(watch this video by CGP Grey)]( URL_0 ). This system suppresses multiple party systems, with each person having only 1 vote, it empowers the leaders and discourages smaller groups from attempting to get a say in the system. **Example:** The Owl Party is fiscally conservative and the Hawk party is fiscally liberal, but supports foreign intervention. These are the two dominant parties Zylandia. A break away from the Hawk party wants fiscally liberal but is against foreign intervention. They want to vote for leaders who are like Hawks mostly, what they lack is popular vote because they are new. In First Past the Post / One Person One Vote systems, everyone gets only one vote, and similar candidates will share votes because there is a lot of overlap, so when a race is intra-party (Talon vs Hawk) it is okay. However with Interparty races people who would support the Talon party will feel pressured to vote for the Hawk Party representatives because the Hawk party has more wide spread support and without the support of the Talon party will lose against the Owl party. And Talons dislike Owls more than they dislike Hawks. Because Hawks and Talons are kind of similar, so it's better to get a Hawk in than an Owl. In a multi vote system a Talon supporter could vote for their Talon candidate as their primary vote, and then the Hawk candidate as a second choice. In this way people get to vote for who best exemplifies their beliefs without forcing them to choose between a loser and the dominant party. Forcing all people to vote into one person gives the group of citizens who are most stubborn extraordinary amount of power; ie: religious zealots. 3. Money, the current political system is coin operated, please insert hundreds of thousands of dollars to run for Senate Without fiscal support from wealthy donors or Super PACs many possible candidates cannot have competitive races simply because they cannot raise name awareness, hire employees, and combat attack advertisements. For us to have a truly representative nation for our citizens, our citizens should be able to vote for who they believe most represents themselves by both voting for the person, and voting for the political party, and for our potential politicians to work at on the same even ground. There is a reason why most of our top level politicians are from wealthy families. **tl;dr:** we need to organize nationally a new more important party than republican or democrat, under one agenda. That agenda is to fix the system so that it can be more representative of the citizenship of the U.S. This allows moderate and more hardline conservative and liberals to vote for their candidates without being controlled by small but powerful groups of people.\",\n",

But that debacle is another story. Point is, they *assume* you\\'re going to fulfill some sort of obligation to the party and vote for whoever they put up because dammit, the ~~Capulets and Montagues~~ Republicans and Democrats oppose each other! CGP Grey covers a lot about how/why we keep ending up with the two party system even though voters have been dissatisfied with it repeatedly. Those videos are worth a watch. But really, if nobody owns any votes yet--because the election is in the *future* and thus they haven\\'t been obtained, why is anyone a \"main\" candidate? Some may roll their eyes and some may choke back their own vomit, but the Libertarian Party is more viable this election than ever before. Don\\'t like the two main choices? Don\\'t vote for them! Encourage others to follow suit. Turn the tables on anyone who thinks \"you\\'re just helping Trump/Clinton by voting third party\" by asking them why, if they don\\'t like Trump/Clinton, they would vote for them and make *you* feel bad for not joining their lesser-of-two-evils conquest? Don\\'t they know that those votes only belong to the candidates who\\'ve earned them? Don\\'t they know that if everyone joins *your* cause, Gary Johnson (or whoever the Libertarian nominee is) can defeat Clinton/Trump? It\\'s simple mathematics! And some will talk about spoilers like Ross Perot, but the thing is, voters haven\\'t been this \"cornered\" by terrible options before. If you\\'re concerned about the effectiveness of your third party vote, there\\'s at least a glimmer of a chance that a third party might actually take it this year.

       "    \"Because the status quo has inertia. People are afraid to make big changes in the status quo. Right now, the schools are open, most people have jobs, the police and the courts more or less work, water comes out of the tap, and foreigners aren't conquering us. If you make big changes, who knows if we'll get to keep those things? People prefer small, incremental changes. They really want the election to be about shifting things slightly one direction versus not shifting them at all, or at most versus shifting them slightly the other direction. So if you want a big change all at once, you're not going to get your way on this unless two things happen. First of all, some huge crisis resulting in mass casualties has to happen all over the country, for a long time, with no hope of it getting better. And secondly, you have to convince them that of all of the non status quo things they could do about that, they should pick yours. If you don't have those things, then it wouldn't even do you any good if there was a Presidential candidate who agreed with you. He or she would just lose. Alternatively, you could persuade the American people that want you want isn't all *that* big of a change. Which relates to the next issue, persuasion. Because maybe you have a cause that you want to see a President champion, and none of them are talking in favor of what you want. Well, if that's true, that's because you, and other people who agree with you, haven't made your case. You don't do that through partisan politics. You do that through issue-oriented political groups. You do that by writing popular books, by making popular songs, by making art that becomes popular.

       "    'Think of love as a \"co-operation strategy\" between males and females where the alternative for both sexes would be to cheat for slightly different reasons, although it would only be an advantage if the other partner did not cheat as well. ----------------------------------------------------- Humans are mammals, and our sexual behavior is consistent with our Linnaean class. Donald Symons sums up the ethnographic record on sex differences in sexuality: “Among all peoples it is primarily men who court, woo, proposition, seduce, employ love charms and love magic, give gifts in exchange for sex, and use the services of prostitutes.”32 Among Western peoples, studies have shown that men seek a greater number of sexual partners than women, are less picky in their choice of a short-term partner, and are far more likely to be customers for visual pornography.33 But the male of Homo sapiens differs from the male of most other mammals in a crucial way: men invest in their offspring rather than leaving all the investing to the female. Though deprived of organs that can siphon nutrients directly into his children, a man can help them indirectly by feeding, protecting, teaching, and nurturing them. The minimum investments of a man and a woman are still unequal, because a child can be born to a single mother whose husband has fled but not to a single father whose wife has fled. But the investment of the man is greater than zero, which means that women are also predicted to compete in the mate market, though they should compete over the males most likely to invest (and the males with the highest genetic quality) rather than the males most willing to mate. The genetic economics of sex also predicts that both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, though for partly different reasons. A philandering man can have additional offspring by impregnating women other than his wife. A philandering woman can have better offspring by conceiving a child by a man with better genes than her husband while having her husband around to help nurture the child. But when a wife gets the best of both worlds from her affair, the husband gets the worst of both worlds, because he is investing in another man\\'s genes that have usurped the place of his own. We thus get the flip side of the evolution of fatherly feelings: the evolution of male sexual jealousy, designed to prevent his wife from having another man\\'s child. {253} Women\\'s jealousy is tilted more toward preventing the alienation of a man\\'s affections, a sign of his willingness to invest in another woman\\'s children at the expense of her own. ------------------------------------------------------------- Donald Symons has argued that we have genetic conflict to thank for the fact that we have feelings toward other people at all.88 Consciousness is a manifestation of the neural computations necessary to figure out how to get the rare and unpredictable things we need. We feel hunger, savor food, and have a palate for countless fascinating tastes because food was hard to get during most of our evolutionary history. We don\\'t normally feel longing, delight, or fascination regarding oxygen, even though it is crucial for survival, because it was never hard to obtain. We just breathe. The same may be true of conflicts over kin, mates, and friends. I mentioned that if a couple were guaranteed to be faithful, to favor each other over their kin, and to die at the same time, their genetic interests would be identical, wrapped up in their common children. One can even imagine a species in which every couple was marooned on an island for life and their offspring dispersed at maturity, never to return. Since the genetic interests of the two mates are identical, one might at first think that evolution would endow them with a blissful perfection of sexual, romantic, and companionate love. But, Symons argues, nothing of the sort would happen. The relation between the mates would evolve to be like the relation among the cells of a single body, whose genetic interests are also identical. Heart cells and lung cells don\\'t {268} have to fall in love to get along in perfect harmony. Likewise, the couples in this species would have sex only for the purpose of procreation (why waste energy?), and sex would bring no more pleasure than the rest of reproductive physiology such as the release of hormones or the formation of the gametes:  >  There would be no falling in love, because there would be no alternative mates to choose among, and falling in love would be a huge waste. You would literally love your mate as yourself, but that\\'s the point: you don\\'t really love yourself, except metaphorically; you are yourself. The two of you would be, as far as evolution is concerned, one flesh, and your relationship would be governed by mindless physiology.... You might feel pain if you observed your mate cut herself, but all the feelings we have about our mates that make a relationship so wonderful when it is working well (and so painful when it is not) would never evolve. Even if a species had them when they took up this way of life, they would be selected out as surely as the eyes of a cave-dwelling fish are selected out, because they would be all cost and no benefit. ----------------------------------------------- Source: [The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature - Chapter 14: The Many Roots of Our Suffering]( URL_0 )',\n",

It\\'s what you always get when you tell cells or leaves or branches or scales to just \"grow more of yourself.\"',\n",

It is 'pop' science, tenuously connected to a wide array of natural processes because people find that idea aesthetically pleasing. *Mathematically*, the golden ratio is fascinating. It is the irrational number with the simplest continued fraction expansion...  >  1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / ... ... and it is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci numbers *do* show up in science, in ((almost?) exclusively biological) natural processes, though this relationship also doesn't occur as much in nature as is often claimed. The number of spiral patterns in the arrangements of leaves around branches, petals around flowers, and scales around pine cones are often consecutive Fibonacci numbers - see [phyllotaxis]( URL_0 ) - and the higher those numbers get the closer the placement of elements around those spirals is related to the golden angle (the golden mean as applied to the circumference of a circle). This arrangement arises because it is the simplest and most efficient way to arrange petals (for example) such that they all get the maximum amount of sunlight with the least amount of work. In a sense the golden ratio is a lot like a Platonic 'ideal' - the idea that circles (for example) are always just approximations of some ideal perfect circle, that the forms of everything we see in nature are imperfect shadows of pure ideal forms that we cannot perceive directly. In that sense the golden ratio is the ideal, perfect relationship that is approximated in natural forms by the Fibonacci numbers. This leads some people to assume that there must be something universally important about the golden ratio, in the way that ideal-but-inaccessible forms were considered important to ancient Greek philosophers. But such ideas are in the realm of philosophy, not physics. tl,dr: the golden ratio is fascinating in mathematics as the eventual limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and as an organizing principle in some spiral biological processes. Claims that the golden ratio has some other significance or cosmic relevance might be interesting philosophically, but they have little to do with science.\",\n",

Or to modify behavior. Each of those three traditions asks a child to believe in the impossible in exchange for a reward. These are stepped-up tests to build a child's faith and imagination. The first test is to believe in a magical person, with toys as the reward. The second test is to trust in a magical animal, with candy as the reward. The last test is the most difficult, with the most abstract reward: To believe, trust in a flying fairy that will leave money. From a man to an animal to a fairy. From toys to candy to money. Thus, interestingly enough, transferring the magic of faith and trust from sparkling fairy-dom to clumsy, tarnished coins. From gossamer wings to nickels... dimes... and quarters. In this way, a child is stepped up to greater feats of imagination and faith as he or she matures. Beginning with Santa in infancy, and ending with the Tooth Fairy as the child acquires adult teeth.

       "  'output': {'38860786': [\"EDIT: Done Socialism is the social/democratic ownership of the means of production. It's considered bad because socialism took over a third of the world and was the biggest threat to the American way of life since Nazi Germany, and even then that was a European war. The rallying against socialism movement started when the US put the CPUS (Communist Party of the United States) on trial, and arrested them due to fears of an American Bolshevik revolution which would topple the capitalist system.  URL_0  This event destroyed socialist leadership. It was very public and served as a warning to ALL socialists in America. This is the origin of socialism's lack of precedence in the US and its hatred. Socialism is no longer practiced by any countries except Cuba. Europe is not socialist, but a Social Democracy. Now, I want to explain what the definition of socialism means, and I am a socialist and have been for a few years now. Social/Democratic ownership. This means that society as a whole has ownership, and society can democratically control whatever they own. Think of a table of kindergarteners and they have a box of crayons in the middle. This type of ownership would look like 5 of the kids voting that they use yellow to color the sun, while 3 kids vote for the sun to be colored green. Because 5 > 3, they color the sun yellow. This is opposed to capitalism's private ownership, where instead of society as a whole having ownership, it is one person or a group of people. Next, means of production, the thing that society is owning. Means of production means any facility, resource, or tool that can create a physical and tangible product. Factories, assemblies, oil, uranium, trees, maybe even basic tools like a hammer and nails. (though sometimes the tools are considered too insignificant to qualify) Under socialism, personal property still exists. Family photos, heirlooms, personal belongings, and cars are things you can still privately own because they are NOT means of production. Money does not count as a means of production because it does not directly create a physical or tangible product. Rather, it is used as a medium to exchange for products created by the means of production. Ok, so thats the definition. Next I am going to talk a bit about the different types of socialism. Left Libertarianism: Anarchism and socialist minarchism. Contrary to popular belief, anarchism denotes a socialist economy unless specifically stated to be anarcho-capitalist. These socialist ideologies actually make up the most of the socialist community right now. Most socialists are libertarian socialists. Democratic Socialism: A type of socialism where a representative democracy like what all western civilizations have now is used alongside a socialist economy. Contrary to another popular belief, Europe is not democratic socialist, and one of the more famous examples of this was the Paris Commune. Market Socialism: I'm not a market socialist and I'm not too clear what the exact mechanics are here, but socialism does not always mean planned economy. This ideology wants socialism AND free market to coexist. Market socialists, feel free to expand on this. Marxist Socialism: I don't really want to call this a well fleshed out ideology, because Marxism was a critique of capitalism, not really an ideology of socialism in itself. However, Karl Marx did vaguely go over his idea of socialism.  > Karl Marx had said in his works that socialism is ONLY possible if the transitioning country is INDUSTRIALIZED and DEVELOPED.  > His thought process on how society would transition was something like this:  > **PreCap(feudalism?)** **- > **  > **Capitalism(industrialization/developing)** **- > **  > **Proletarian Revolution** **- > **  > **Socialist state** **- > **  > **Abolishment of state(communism)** Leninist Socialism/all derivatives(Marxist Leninism, Maoism, etc)/Communism: BEFORE I explain this, I must first note something that even socialists get wrong. The word 'communism' is a capitonym. This means that its definition changes based on capitalization. 'C'ommunism is what I will be talking about right here. It refers to Leninist states or states with a vanguard/Communist Party. 'c'ommunism on the otherhand, means stateless, classless, moneyless society. It is the end goal of most socialist ideologies, including the one I am going to talk about here. So, Leninism/Communism is when the 'best of the best' of the workers take control of the government and establish a Communist or Vanguard Party, which should mean a technocracy because the government is controlled by the workers, but this elite group in the government, the state, owns everything as opposed to society. This is justified by saying that the technocratic government is representing the interests of society, so it is social and democratic ownership by an extension. Unlike Marx's idea of socialism where socialism can only be achieved in a developed capitalist state, Leninism was practiced ONLY in undeveloped, newly capitalist or precapitalist states. Lenin seemed fine with this, but he agreed with Marx that the best place for revolution was in a developed country. (which at the time of the early 1900's was Germany) Additionally, when the 'conditions' are 'right' (world socialism has been achieved) the state 'withers away' and the end goal of 'c'ommunism is achieved. In Leninism, there is supposed to be a counteracting 'checks and balances' system called the soviet councils. These are councils across the country made up of workers. Just like how in the US the courts scale all the way to the Supreme court, the councils scale all the way to the Supreme Soviet. This was supposed to exist to counteract the power of the Communist Party. When Stalin came along, he consolidated his power by stripping many of the capabilities of the soviets, including the Supreme Soviet, so that the checks and balances was weak to nonexistent. Next, Social Democracy: Social Democracy technically means 2 different things. It originally meant socialist reformism: the idea that socialism can be attained through reforming of the current system. Social Democracy calls for the reform of our system to democratic socialism. This was unpopular at that time (1800-early 1900's) as most socialists were revolutionaries and believed that the only way for socialism to exist is through a revolution. (democratic socialism was still popular, but most supporters were revolutionaries) Now? Social democracy means a powerful welfare state and a government that actively looks after their citizens. Progressive taxes, free healthcare and education, some state ownership, all hallmarks of a social democracy. This definition of social democracy is NOT socialist, nor does it actually want to be socialist. I'm not going to talk about how socialism could be good or bad for Americans, or how if it works well with other countries, because it seems to boil to opinion and semantics on what 'works well' and 'good and bad' means. If someone wants to share their opinion, yeah go ahead, but OP you will always get a different response. I will finish this off with a real ELI5 example to help understand socialism:\",\n",
       "    ' > The concept of socialism is incredibly warped in the west, almost entirely as a bad thing. No, not in the West. Just in the US.',\n",
       "    \" >  almost entirely as a bad thing That's not necessarily the case in many countries in Europe, where it's mostly viewed as another political orientation; like the green, conservative, liberal or christian-democratic movements; which exist in many European countries. But I suspect that this perception is equally inaccurate in it's depiction of socialism in it's original form\",\n",
       "    'Socialism means that the means of production (factories, farms, etc) are controlled by the workers. So how can that manifest in practice? Well you could have market socialism, for instance. In this case, you\\'d have a free market just like you do now, but a company would be jointly owned by everyone who worked for it, and the leadership would be elected democratically. If democracy works for states, why not companies? Another option might be a centrally planned economy with a democratically elected government. The \"democratically elected\" part is key, because if the people doing the planning aren\\'t held accountable to the workers, then its not really worker control of the means of production. This is why many socialists would say that the Soviet Union was \\'state capitalist\\' - the means of production were privately controlled by a single ruling party.',\n",
       "    \"Socialism at its rawest form is everyone collectively trying to help each other. However, just like democracy where everyone is suppose to get one vote, it doesn't necessarily work out in its rawest form. So what you end up with are different takes on Socialism. Social democracy is probably what you have heard the most of recently if you have heard of Bernie Sanders and references to Nordic countries. In Social democracy the economy is still ran in a capitalist economy, meaning private ownership (still some public however), and companies ran how the owners want, but government usually taxes them heavily to provide social programs like education, housing, healthcare, minimum wages and so forth. Marxism-Leninism is the other style of socialism. Where one person or a small party is in charge as a dictatorship (so no removing them), the economy is ran under communism ideologies, so the government owns and controls most of the needs of production, wages, food supplies and everything. And then you can find other types as well, like China which is a dictatorship, that has allowed capitalist ideologies into the countries, but any powerful company is usually going to have a communist party member inserted into their company to watch things.\",\n",
       "    'There\\'s no more distorted view of what \"socialism\" is than what you have probably picked up in the American public. **Neither Europe nor any other 1st world county is socialist** or even anywhere near to being socialist.

You might have heard that Europe is socialist because we get free health care, maternity leave or lots of paid days off. It\\'s almost embarassing that politicans feel like they can actually get away with non-sense like that; maybe they even believe what they are saying but that would be even worse, I guess.

       "  'output': {'3934010': ['Beer (and wine and mead) come first. All other alcoholic beverages are products of refining (properly \"distilling\") the various beers into stronger mixtures. So to make vodka, for instance, one makes a potato mash, then ferments that mash into potato beer, then uses heat and condensation to separate the alcohol from the water, concentrating the beer into a liquor. So beer isn\\'t \"more important\" as a comparison of equals, it\\'s a predicate. So the invention of the wheel is more _significant_ than the invention of the tire, because you have to make the wheel _first_ and wrapping that wheel with padding makes it into a tire. Without the predicate the follow-on technology never happens. So without beer there are no other alcoholic beverages. In general the historians talking about this subject are talking about the \"big three\" - beer, wine, and mead - when they talk about the discovery of beer. Since wine needs specifically grapes, and mead needs the domestication of honey, while beer can be made from any grain or sugar in general, it\\'s something of an understood generalization. There is far more beer-making land throughout the cradles of civilization than there is wine or mead producing land. So the beer is though to come before the domestication of bees for mead, the domestication of the grape for wine, the domestication and enrichment of fruit trees for cider. So the various grain beers was likely first and foremost, and certainly lead to the invention of the other alcohols. There is some evidence that it also lead to the domestication of yeasts and so the baking of leavened bread.',\n",
       "    \"So, some real booze historians could give you more info (consider asking r/beer or r/wine), but to me there's two ways to take this. 1) Beer isn't the sole important alcohol in history, you're forgetting wine. Wine dates back thousands of years, and in the AD calendar the importance of wine can't be underestimated (especially considering the rise of Christianity). There are monastic orders that have made beer for centuries (Trappist, others), but to my understanding wine has been an essential part of Catholic/Christian ceremonies for a long, long time. Wine even did relatively well during prohibition in the US because of church usage. So, I would argue wine is equally important, if not more. 2) Include beer and wine, same question. My best guess would be that a lower alcohol percentage drink allows people to still be functional after consumption, where something like Brandy is going to make someone drunk, worthless, and a social outcast (you can't function when you're hammered, and especially in early cultures you had to be able to contribute to the group in some way). Also, distilled liquor required, well, a still. Wine or beer (I think) can theoretically be made in any kind of clay pot or vessel. Then liquor has to taste good. You still can't drink too much of it if it's high proof. There's centuries old liqueurs and Brandy and grappa that fit the bill, but for the few historical successes there must be thousands others there were lost to time because they didn't do a good job tasting good, being easy to produce, and allowing people to be functional. Just my best guess, I'm not great on the technical side of booze but I work in the restaurant industry and these conjectures are based on my limited understanding. Edit: One of the big things I missed is the ease of growing grain compared to fruit (worldwide). Also, the proof is less important than the actual ease of making wine/beer. Some people are pointing out beer was safer to drink than water, but some people are disputing it. I don't my know, I'm not a German beer doctor.\",\n",
       "    \"This is something I can contribute to very well. I've given lectures at universities and museums on the history of beer. It's a fascinating topic that I love delving in to. If I go long my apologies, but beer is so important to our civilization. As has been stated several times in this thread, it's the reason why we became an agricultural society instead of just hunter/gatherers. It's the reason we have society. In early Mesopotamia it was also used as currency. Hell, Jewish slaves were paid in bowls of beer, it wasn't beer as we know it today, but it was a porridge-like substance that was created with grain and water. The pyramids were built on beer. I stated earlier that the reason why wine is used in Christianity is because it was easy to grow grapes in Italy and as Christianity spread through the Roman Empire that became the norm. If you couldn't grow grapes you had to buy it from Italians and thus helping their economy. It that time beer became a lesser drink in the eyes of many. As beer became a drink and not just for food its secrets were passed down through the monks. Which has also been stated several times in this thread. What I havent seen mentioned is the importance of Reinheitsgebot. In 1514 Bavaria passed a law stating that beer could only be malted grain (barley, oats, wheat, rye), hops, and water (later amended to include yeast). This is significant because it was the first food law passed in the history of humanity. At the time people were trying to balance out the sweetness of beer with whatever they could find. It was called gruit and it could include figs, dates, sticks, and even charcoal (again, not as refined as we know it today). Beer was important because it kept people alive, but some of the ingredients were killing people or making them sick. They decided on hops because, like the Counsel of Nicaea, they chose an available crop that was easy to grow in the area. Hops. Hops became the standard for the bittering agent in beer because both Germany and England could grow them and it helped the local economy. Beer also helped the Champagne region of France with exploding bottles. The Belgians have many styles of beer that have residual sugars still in them, much like champagne. The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode. The Belgians put a divot in the bottle to break up the amount of concentrated sugar in one area and thus the bottles wouldn't explode. Pasteur was looking at wine when he discovered yeast, but IIRC refrigeration was developed to cool wort quicker. I have to look that up though. Beer took a big hit after prohibition in America. With the WWII soldiers coming home from Germany and developing a love for the taste of pilsners, and the rise of Bud and Miller, beer was thought as a one trick pony. It wasn't until Carter passed a law in the 70's allowing for homebrewing that we see the start of the rise of craft beer in America. Styles that were dead became revitalized (i.e. IPA) and depth of the beverage really started to emerge. Beer is incredibly important to us as a society. It helped form us and shape how we became. I can literally talk for hours on the subject. This is the cliffs notes version that I can pull from memory, I'd need to do more homework to get it down a bit more proper. But, until I can get paid for it, why the hell am I going to do it.\",\n",
       "    \"Food Scientist here. One of the fundamental importances of beer is the fact that it was the only safe form of drinking water for many people. As old towns grew, the water supply became more contaminated and disease was quite prevalent. The water supplies were full of bacteria. Now, bacteria don't thrive in alcoholic solutions, even low alcohol, and so by fermenting the water, it was effectively disinfecting it for drinking. Why beer though, and not other drinks? Grains are very prevalent and have been for millennia, they offer nutrition which carries through to the beer and when malted, are easily fermentable. Originally the beer was spiced and flavoured with all sorts of plants to make gruit. The switch to using hops was because of the superior flavour, and more importantly, the antibacterial properties of hops which further improved the benefit of drinking beer over lake or river water. EDIT: I hurriedly wrote this out and missed an essential part, which is the boil, which kills a lot of the bacteria. Much of the rest of the brewing and fermentation makes it harder for bacteria to grow. Just because not all bacteria will die in beer, does not mean it is just as unsafe as some water sources in the past. Many breweries formed because of the increase in populations and industrialisation when the water was at it's worst (last few hundred years)\",\n",
       "    \"Because you can provide weak beer to people in times of clean water scarcity without getting them too drunk. Old castles have records of beer quotas for men women and children. The beer was very weak by today's standards. If memory servers correctly it was 2 pints for children, 4 for women and six for men. China has a rich tea and porcelain culture for similar reasons.\",\n",
       "    \"Fermentation of liquids and the creation of low-alcoholic beverages was revolutionary for several reasons. First-off, it's due to the fact that the creation and treatment of alcohol cleansed the liquid. Early man had no reliable access to clean, drinking water on a consistent basis sometimes, and as they did not understand the method of treating water, or boiling it to cleanse out impurities and kill bacteria, the creation of drinks like Mead and Beer allowed for a reliable way to create healthy, safe drinking fluids that could be drunk regardless of the water content (to an extent). Next, its storable. Water, back in the millenia ago, could easily become tainted. Leaving out barrels filled with water could inadvertantly introduce pests or contaminants that would ruin an entire barrel of fluid. Low-ABV liquids made contained just enough alcohol to make long term storage a viable means of transporting or storing liquid. This was especially important when out at sea, as water would only be good for 2-3 weeks before becoming contaminated by some means. A barrel of mead however, would stay good for weeks, or months, and if properly stored could keep a crew hydrated long after water would have gone bad.\",\n",
       "    'IIRC there is even a theory that we became farmers (instead of hunter gatherers) for beer. Not because of it, for it. In order to produce beer you need grain, and in order to ferment it you need to stay put for a while.',\n",
       "    \"Because it goes hand in hand with the rise of agriculture! Beer and bread were invented simultaneously in ancient Sumeria. as they involve the same basic ingredients - ground wheat and yeast. Yeast would have been airborne to start with, and both processes would likely have involved soaking the kernels to soften them. You could make bread from the solid bits, and the liquid bits would have been beer. It's an ancient drink. In the Americas, the Wari went through a similar process with corn. Agriculture spread quickly across ancient Peru, because the Wari realized that by growing slightly more corn than you needed to live, you could brew it into a fantastic party drink. Their empire spread based on this teaching, they built huge stone terraces and had dance festivals, and worshiped gods of drink. The drinking cup was sacred. It was basically corn beer, and is still popular to this day.\",\n",

There\\'s evidence in pottery about how out brewing skills improved Wine: only existed in vast quantities once the Greeks appeared and then the Romans who exported it everywhere. It also helps this reigned through the Middle Ages warn period, when favorable climate conditions allowed grapes to be grown even in England Spirits: the process of distillation had been invented, and the age of exploration made it useful. Spirits did not spoil on long voyages, sailors were willingly paid in it and the new triangle trade found a perfect use for the waste material from sugar production (molasses made to rum). Also, one of the first cocktails called old grog featured a lime which helped the English with scurvy and gave them the name limeys. Tea and coffee:both related heavily with trade and the exploitation of India/south America and colonialism. Coke: it came after the industrial revolution and the invention of carbonate water. There was a trend of pseudo medical drinks that would do all sorts of things. Coca of course coming from cocaine, and cola coming from a nut.

If you go out and pick a bunch of apples/grapes and crush the juice out of them and leave it for a few days it'll start to ferment. Leave it alone for a week or so and you'll have cider/wine. Beer requires a much more involved process that requires processing the grains to get the enzyes in them to chemically change starches into sugars that the yeast can ferment, then the extraction of those sugars from the grain, and then the manual addition of yeast. So it's a much more delibrate process and represents technological developments that wine and cider do not. For another - while grapes or apples are somewhat geographically limited, grains are more ubiquitous. Meaning that you can make a beer of some sort anywhere in the world that grains can be grown, which is almost anywhere humans inhabit - so it was a technlogical development that was relevant on a global scale.\",\n",

       "    'There is a great book called The Thinking Drinkers Guide to Alcohol by Ben McFarland and Tom Sandham. I\\'ll put a couple quotes from the book below: \"Beer, lest we forget, is the world\\'s oldest recipe, first scribbled on a clay tabled by the Ancient Sumerians. It sustained early civilization; it helped build the Pyramids; it oiled the wheels of the Industrial Revolution in Britain; it stoked the fires of discontent that sparked the American one; it\\'s what Elizabeth I had for breakfast; it\\'s what Winston Churchill drank regardless of the time of day; it was the heartbeat of the British Empire; it started wars and it finished them; it was the drink of Henry VIII and Homer Simpson; and it is as Jack Nicholson so succinctly pointed out, \\'the best damn drink in the world.\\'\" When Jesus Christ turns water into wine at a wedding \"It\\'s his finest trick yet it fails to withstand even the most rudimentary form of scrutiny. Jesus would never have done that. We\\'re not saying it couldn\\'t be done, but if Jesus was going to turn water into any alcoholic beverage at a wedding, then it would definitely have been beer. You don\\'t have to delve deep into dusty tomes dating back centuries, as we have done, to know that Jesus was a beer guy. Just look at his clothes. As anyone who\\'s ever been to a Real Ale festival will testify, Jesus bore all the hallmarks of a beer boffin--a beard and sandals. And he hung around with other men who had beards and sandals. Let\\'s hit you with some historical fact here: Ancient Israel, where Jesus lived, was flanked by Egypt and Mesopotamia--both big beer nations. Mesopotamia was where the Sumerians first scribbled down the formula for brewing and in Ancient Egypt, beer was used as both an enema and currency (not the SAME beer). The chaps that built the Pyramids were paid with 10 pints of ale every day--which is why they forgot to put any windows in. Geographical evidence? In Ancient Israel, barley was grown and consumed in big quantities and not used only for bread-making. The soil was better suited to growing grain than grapes and regardless of gender or class, every Ancient Israelite would have drunk beer in Jesus\\'s day. The Bible is rife with references to beer (shekhar). Yahweh, God of Israel and the Judah kingdoms, drinks around 4 pints of beer every day (and even more on the Sabbath day), beer is eulogyzed as a medicine for melancholy (Proverbs 31:6), and moderate beer drinking is recommended--Isaiah 5:11, 28:7 Proverbs 20:1, 31:4) with over-indulgence discouraged. Despite numerous mentions in the original scriptures, beer often goes missing in modern translations. Why? Well, the etymological bone of contention centres on the Hebrew word shekhar, meaning \"strong drink\". Many attribute it to wine, but there\\'s every indication to suggest that \"beer\" is the more faithful translation. Of the 20 times shekhar is mentioned, only once does it appear without the accompanying word for wine. What\\'s more, the word shekhar derives from Sikaru, an ancient Semitic term meaning \"barley beer\". But we reckon the real reason veer vanished from subsequent versions of the Bible is sheer scholarly snobbery. When the Bible was first translated into English in the early 17th century, beer was considered a pauper\\'s drink, while wine was popular among \"posh\" folk. In an astonishing display of academic arrogance, translators transformed Jesus Christ from a charitable beer-drinking friend of the people into a nouveau-riche playboy with designer sunglasses and leather loafers. But that\\'s not how Jesus rolled. He was a blue collar Messiah with no wish to drink wine. After all, the Romans drank wine and, as we all know, Jesus didn\\'t get on with the Romans.\"',\n",

Grapes prefer colder climates whereas grains are more temperate and have a larger climate range. With wine, you harvest once per year (autumn) and have to process and store on the spot. When grains, they can be grown at least half the year (winter to summer), you can transport them, and you can make beer all year round wherever you like. Each \"batch\\' of beer takes one month (12 batches per year) whereas your one wine batch must start in autumn. Grains are multi use - the can also be used for bread.',\n",

For most working class people, beer was both an essential source of nutrition and hydration (it wasn't very alcoholic or carbonated. Think of it like an ancient protein shake.) The most important thing, however, was that it was cleaner than most water sources. Boiling water as a sanitation process wasn't quite known, but part of making beer is boiling wort (beer before beer becomes beer) which also sanitized it and made it safe to drink. The alcohol content would also help to keep bacteria and viruses at bay.\",\n",

Vikings would use a yeast covered stick to stir their sugary grain water concoction and it would magicly start fermenting.

So if you want to have ping of less than 20 ms, that is, 0.02 seconds, route from you to the server and back needs to be less than 0.02s * 100,000km/s = 2,000km. So if you live within 1000km of the server, you can achieve ping of 20ms, at least, in theory. There are some extra troubles here. Server can\\'t respond to you instantly, it takes some time to figure out what kind of response you want. Also you have some processing to do on your end as well, drawing a single frame takes about 10 milliseconds from your gpu, and also non-gaming displays can have like 20ms delay between fame being ready to be shown on your computer, and the frame being actually shown. But anyhow, if you are within 1000km of the server, you should be seeing whatever server wants to show you within 0.1 seconds of you requesting this information. This to a human is almost unnoticeable delay. If the distance grows however, ping becomes more and more significant factor in causing delay, and at about 0.3s, it\\'s very close to impossible to not notice this delay. So that\\'s the basics of physics behind this. So how do games do this? A typical solution is that there is a central server, as before, which has something called \"tick rate\". Every tick, the server sends a packet describing what the server thinks the game world is like. Your computer then displays this world, and if you move or do something else in the game, your computer sends this data to server and once server receives your actions, it includes these in the next tick it composes. I know Valve games use tick rate of 64 ticks per second. Which is sort of nice, but if your actions have to go through server to be shown to you, this means there is distinct feeling of lack of control that can cause things like nausea if the delay between actions you make and these actions being shown on screen grows too large. So games typically cheat a bit. They try to guess what the server is thinking at the moment, and incorporate your own actions onto game world immediately. This means what you\\'re being shown isn\\'t actually the world as server tick describes it, but prediction like \"if the last tick was sent 15ms ago(taking network lag into account) and said the world looks like that, what would the game world look like now, 15ms later?\" So there are two closely linked game worlds your computer tries to keep in sync. Which usually works fine, but sometimes these worlds go off sync because of too much lag. This causes things like characters stuttering, warping around the map, things like that. But if everything works fine, your computer is able to make rather reasonable predictions about what\\'s gonna happen next and these guesses and actual ticks stay in sync, so the game looks butter smooth to you even with about 100ms lag or something like that as game draws based on these predictions rather than waiting for server to confirm anything, and only after the fact it makes sure everything went as intended. If not, these sudden corrections are what cause warping, as your computer has to very fast fix position from predicted position to where the server tells that object actually is at. Lots of these kinds of corrections and everything just warps and stutters around your screen. With voice communications, lag can become much higher before you start noticing the delay. You probably would not notice 1 second delay on a voice chat that easily.',\n",

Sometimes, if you have a poor internet connection, you\\'ll notice stuttering, lagging, or buffering. That\\'s because there\\'s something in the way, usually slow connection from getting all those packets of data reliably. so to move on to the next packet and keep up with \"real life\" timing, the data is dumped.

If you press the forward button, your character starts moving immediately while the input is sent to the server in the background. The other players won't see your character move until the server has informed them of that, but you see it immediately. The problem is, this means that everyone's version of the game is slightly out of sync, because they are all receiving inputs at different times. Therefore, the server must periodically send corrections to the clients to keep them all in sync.

So, let\\'s pretend your job is making Ninja Turtle action figures in my Ninja Turtle factory. I pay you ten gummy bears an hour for making these Ninja Turtle dolls. Now, I think you\\'re a good worker, so I want to pay you fifteen gummy bears instead of ten. The U.S. government steps in and says, \"No! That\\'s not fair. You can only pay ecfunj1 ten gummy bears an hour. That\\'s the law. It\\'s for the greater good- we\\'re in a war, doncha know.\" Now I, being the staunchly capitalist factory owner that I am, who thinks that you should be paid what you\\'re worth, say, \"Well, you\\'re not the boss of me, Federal Government! I think ecfunj1 should get more money.\" However, not wanting to go to jail, I devise a way around this ridiculous statute. Instead of giving you more money, I pay for your healthcare, which gets around the wage controls set by the government and compensates you more for your labor. Other ways I find to get around this law are paid sick and vacation days. Basically, the reason there is a strong tradition of employer-based healthcare in the United States stems from 1940s government-mandated price and wage controls. Employers who competed in hiring workers in a scarce labor market were unable to pay more money to attract more/better workers. Employers resorted to offering perks, such as health insurance and paid sick/vacation days, to compensate workers more without breaking the law by paying them more. Additionally, there are special tax-deductions in the Tax Code for employer-paid healthcare. Employers are able to reduce their tax burden by providing health insurance to employees, and employees do not report health insurance paid by their employer as income. These special tax privileges reinforced the employer-based health insurance structure that came into existence in the 1940s. Edit: Here\\'s more reading for the economically-curious:  URL_0 ',\n",

The health hazards of early twentieth-century industrial life were tremendous. A demand of organized labor was that companies be responsible for the health damage they inflicted upon the workers and these demands resulted in health insurance provided by employers to large numbers of employees. For a variety of socio-political reasons, from American individualism to strong anti-communist sentiment, attempts to replace the employer-sponsored health care system with a government system like what was developed in the United Kingdom failed. Rent is a benefit which was often provided by employers in the past and in some cases still is. Historical rent providing for lower-paid positions were riddled with abuse where employers would use their control over the living conditions of employees to control their lives in an effort to make them more productive or as methods of recapturing wages. 'Company towns' where employees had little access to housing or goods not provided by their employer gained such a bad reputation that many governments have a variety of rules to try to limit the abuses. It takes a lot of conjecture to explain why some historical trends endure while others are replaced or why others don't even arise.

The extent to which a person is connected to his or her atrocities after the fact depends greatly on who writes the history books and whose stories get included. History is full of revolutionaries whom history glorifies and glosses over their death toll and presents it as \"justified\" or \"necessary\" or \"a bad thing, but that was the way things were back then. we\\'re better now.\" And some get more of this than others.

These types of metal react with oxygen to form an impervious oxide layer that prevents from any water or oxygen to be in contact with the metal, hence preventing corrosion. Other examples of such metals include Aluminium and Chromium. The opposite of these metals are known as 'active' metals and include Iron and Magnesium - which can be easily corroded.\",\n",
       "    'All chemical reactions are based on interactions between the electrons of atoms. To understand rust and tarnish, you need to understand how metals react. Rust and tarnish are generally made when a metal reacts with other compounds containing oxygen or sulfur in the surrounding environment (air/water/ground) and water. Other commenters have talked about how stable gold is, but the chemical reason behind this stability is due to gold\\'s \"valence\" electrons; the outermost electrons in a gold atom. These electrons are the ones that are able to react. These electrons are found in regions around the atom called orbitals which can only take a certain amount of electrons before they fill up. What we see in gold (and other group 11 elements) is that the orbitals which contain the reactive electrons are actually at full capacity. Atoms like it a lot when these orbitals are filled and it ends up taking too much energy to add or remove an electron from a gold atom for a reaction to happen with oxygen or sulfur. This makes gold really resistant to oxidation (rusting/tarnishing). Iron, on the other hand, is very reactive with water/oxygen and forms rust (Iron Oxide) pretty quickly. It gets oxidized by oxygen really quickly because that reaction allows Iron\\'s orbitals to be filled in a more stable way. It then forms the oxide after reacting with water giving us the red rust we see everywhere. Side note, there\\'s actually a difference between tarnish and rust. Tarnish is a layer on top of the metal that insulates it and protects the deeper layers of the metal like the green tarnish on copper (statue of liberty) while rust generally flakes off and cannot protect the metal below (steel and iron rust). This is why iron things left out will eventually rust completely through while the statue of liberty is still standing. There are also quantum reasons for the increased stability of gold which explains why we see tarnish on silver but not gold, but that\\'s a little beyond an ELI5. tl;dr: gold doesn\\'t tarnish because it\\'s happy where it is and it would take too much energy for it to rust or tarnish. P.S. looking up wikipedia\\'s pages on rust, tarnish, oxidation states and electron filling of transition metals will explain everything a lot better than I can :) Edit^2: Iron oxide not aluminum.',\n",
       "    '\"Tarnish\" is the surface of the metal reacting with various things it comes in contact with, producing the discolouration. Kind of like how orange rust forms on iron (Iron III Oxide) or the bright green patina that forms on copper (copper carbonate). Gold is extremely stable. It does not readily react with chemicals found in the environment normally. So because there is nothing that can react with the surface of the gold, the surface stays exactly how it was at manufacture and does not develop a tarnish.',\n",
       "    'Gold does not tarnish easily nor does it form a passivation layer like Aluminum, and while most tarnish is an oxidation reaction, silver and Gold tend to react more with sulphur than oxygen.

Plants need time to adapt. You can\\'t just keep changing things and expect to see results in a day or two. Often times even if they look a little sad it\\'s best to leave them be, especially if they have enough water, light and humidity. They need time. Starting small when buying a plant in general is much better practice, for so many reasons. Just don\\'t put it in a huge pot :) Edit: Wow, didn\\'t think this would get this big lol Thanks so much for such interest in plants and horticulture! To be clear I was mostly talking about house plants in this, since they are a plant that is usually not of the climate where you live and is why they\\'re a house plant because the can\\'t live outside. (But not always- in FL many \"house plants\" can do better outside, depending on the plant still) Doing my best to answer questions- you guys are lucky I\\'m sick and aren\\'t busy outside :P Edit 2: [Here]( URL_1 ) are a couple pages from one of the best houseplant books I\\'ve seen and had. There is helpful info that can be used for other plant types as well. You can get the book off [Amazon]( URL_0 ), its rather inexpensive and 100% worth it. Edit 3: Forgot to stress the fact that many of our tap water had loads of chlorine and chloramine in it. The chlorine can evaporate out if the water is left out before use but the chloramine will not. These are things that can really affect a plant over time. Along with mineral build up from water and fertilizer. [Here\\'s]( URL_2 ) another good resource.',\n",

       "    'In a confined space, like a properly sized pot, nutrients and fluids are easily accessible by roots. In a less confined space, the roots may have to work harder to reach the moist soil and fertilizer, depending on the distribution. Plants out in the wild are quite different. There\\'s a few different ways plants reproduce. Some \"pup\". Pups are children that grown directly off the parents and eventually develop their own root system. In such an instance, the parent provides nutrients until the plant can fend for itself. Another reproduction method is through seeds. Seeds won\\'t germinate and grow if conditions aren\\'t favorable. In other words, when you see seeded plants in the wild, you\\'re only seeing the survivors who were in the right place at the right time. Also worth considering: depending on where in the world you live, wild plants don\\'t really have unlimited soil. The truth is, the healthiest, most nutrient rich growing medium only covers the first couple of inches of soil. Leaves, detritus, and other organic decompositions all provide the sustainability plants need. All this good stuff is created at or juuuuust below the surface. That means there\\'s a trickle-down effect but the further down you go, the less nutrients are available. So, relatively speaking, wild \"pots\" are only 4 inches deep, not unlimitedly deep. Due to competition between other nearby plants all fighting for the same nutrients, that pot is only inches wide as well, and not endlessly\\u200b open space.',\n",
       "    \"Hey there. I work at a nursery, and grow plants for a living. Transplanting a houseplant isn't necessarily a bad idea, and all, it just has some things you need to be aware of. The pros: Getting a bigger pot means a bigger plant in the long term. The cons: Your plant is going to get a lot bigger. Your plant is going to need more (sun)light, water, and fertilizer after the transplant. Your plant will have an adjustment period before its root structure can start filling up the bucket in which you've put it. (be gentle with any transportation). I think you're worried about the period of adjustment when the soil transfer occurs the most. You can match the soil ph levels, and make the transition time less of an issue, if you want. Typically, you'll see things like plants getting droopy, or not growing very quickly. That's not necessarily bad for the plant, and all, its just something you have to manage. The droopy stuff means your root system isn't getting enough water to it. With adequate plant management (make sure it has enough light, water and fertilizer), you should be able to have your plant in a bigger pot without any serious detriments to it, though, when considering the long term health of the plant. Literally my entire field of work is built around that principle.\",\n",
       "    'I have read through many of the replies but have not come across one that hit on a key element of your question. There are variables involved, relative to your question. Different types of plants require different care and will do best with specific mediums (soil mix). Some species of plants are water hogs (such as Spathiphyllum/Peace Lily) and some don’t care how much water they receive (such as Sansevieria/Mother-in-laws Tongue). My Professor from the University of Illinois had said that each of us could grow plants on rocks as long as the conditions were correct. Meaning proper light, nutrients, temperature and air were at a level for the requirement of that particular plant. Thus it is very important to choose the correct potting mix for your plant. I used to be a Florist, Grower and Interiorscaper. In fact I was one of the pioneers to help develop the Interiorscape industry. The most challenging was putting live plants into malls, restaurants and office spaces and is probably the most relevant to your question. I was always battling those who would pour drinks (coffee and soda) into the plants like it was a sink drain. My way around this was to put a cone shaped piece of waxed cardboard around the plant and covered it with mulch material. Then when a person was pouring a drink into the pot it would run over the cone and down into the outer decorative container. This worked very well to help control the liquids that were entering the medium. As for container size, it generally does not matter to the plant as long as it is not over watered and moving to a very large pot, increase the likelihood that a homeowner would make the mistake of watering the plant. By continuing to water at the same frequency with a higher quantity of water (to compensate for the larger pot) would almost guarantee that the plant will develop wet feet. However, some species of plants will not flower or take-off (start to grow) until the roots have taken an abrupt turn in the medium such as growing out and making contact with inner sidewalls of the growing container. The main reason for using smaller containers within a growing operation (greenhouse) is cost per square foot. As a plant progresses to its salable size the plants are bumped up in pot sizes based on the determination of the Head Grower. Having plants in containers that are relative to their size also helps the grower to have much more control over the crop. They can easily vary moisture, adjust nutrient or micro-nutrients levels or if levels go too high, it is much easier to leach the medium when dealing with smaller pot sizes. When plants are placed into a home or interiorscape situation. The medium volume is important so that the plant is easiest to care for. Larger pots will help a plant grow larger as usually determined by what is called “Root-to-Shoot Ratio”. I have found that bottom watering really helps in the Ineriorscape industry as plants are typically cared for and watered once per week in most cases. Bottom watering is a whole different subject as a micro climate is created within the growing medium. Many plants do very well with bottom watering but require a lot of work to set-up right The medium in the container is generally layered with different mixes to properly achieve this type of micro climate that the plant will adapt to. The setup works incredibly well for plants in low light areas and when plants are located in breezy places.',\n",

Too large a pot potentially can screw up the watering, with soil being dry on the surface, wetter below, which can cause interference with drainage and nutrient delivery and buildup.

Confined to a pot the soil stays wet longer and the root system does not have adequate time to grow to fill in the pot. So the water sits in the soil and the plant and roots can not process that amount of moisture, so they rot away.

       "    'Looks like I\\'m too late to this thread, but I will add my own understanding to the pile. Most of the answers touch on the possibility of over watering. Not really having a problem with too much watering, I always thought of it as making the most out of your root ball. The more root mass you have in the soil, the more plant mass can grow. So a baby plant is in like a 2in pot. You give it some time to dry out between waterings. The roots grow down and out and sort of form a cage at the inside edges of the container. The reason we go up about 2 inches to the next pot size is so the next \"root cage\" will form pretty close to the previous one, and so on. If you just take the baby 2in pot size root ball and drop it into a big 5gal bucket or something, the roots will tend to grow out to the edges of the bucket and form the cage. It will probably grow fine. But a plant that was potted incrementally will have a lot more root mass and be a much bigger plant than the one that went straight to the big bucket.',\n",

       "    'Running a tree nursery that specializes in growing in field and containers I have learned a few differences between the two. There are a few reasons why you wouldn\\'t want to put a small plant in a large pot. First thing is that most plants are most efficient when using the whole container for its roots. This makes it easier for the plant to take up nutrients and efficiently use the water. When you put a small plant in a large pot it takes a lot of energy for the roots to grow enough to find the nutrients and water in that larger pot. Since nutrients and water will be sitting in the soil much longer before being used this also creates a space for mold and bacteria to form which can damage your plants. Comparing a container to natural environment is not fair. Containers are dependent on outside influences. The \"soil\" used for indoor containers is nothing like natural soil. It does not hold water the same way as the environment would and does not have drainage like natural ecosystems have. When growing in a container they often need water every few days depending on what type of plant is growing while in the natural environment these plants could easily survive weeks without getting additional moisture in the soil due to the natural water availability of real soil. Another reason that you really don\\'t want to start with too large of a container is most people are not trying to grow a plant much larger in a short period of time. On a nursery we can easily go from a one gallon to a 10 gallon because we are monitoring our inputs to grow the plant to fit the container. It takes a lot of monitoring and experience to push some plants to grow that quickly while retaining the desired growth habits. Basically if you want to slowly grow your plants then slowly upping the container size over time is the best way to do so. If you want to push your plant to grow larger then upping to larger containers faster is fine but need to be careful monitored and controlled to limit disease and rot which are your biggest risks.',\n",

Young garden variety plants can have trouble expanding roots beyond surface soil, and thus retain a shallow root base. If a plant is potted in a small container, used to shallow-soil watering for a long enough time, it will become (I don't know about in every situation, but generally) incapable of expanding much further. Moving it to a larger pot will, then, not necessarily permit further growth, as would happen with a plant grown in the earth. You would, as another poster said, be wasting more water.

Ben - It’s a great effect and it’s a lovely, lovely question because I actually had – I had to look this up and as soon as I read the question, I thought, “That’s brilliant! Why didn’t I look this up before?” But it has all to do with the substance in toothpaste called sodium laureth sulfate. There’s a few similar chemicals that do the same thing. It’s a surfactant which means that it lowers the surface tension of a liquid. Kat - Those are classic cleaners, aren’t they? Ben - Yes. You’ll find it in detergents, you’ll find it in all sorts of different things that rely on breaking surface tension, and it’s in the toothpaste, to make sure that you get a good foam from the toothpaste while you clean your teeth and look a bit rabid. Kat - Speak for yourself... Ben - But they also interact with that taste buds in two key ways: They inhibit the taste buds that perceive sweetness, so whatever you eat afterwards will taste less sweet and then they break up fatty molecules called phospholipids and these phospholipids live on the surface of our tongue, and they inhibit the receptors for bitterness. So, not only do we get the effect through the knocking down of the sweetness, but actually boosting the bitterness that you get as well. So, that means anything you eat will taste less sweet and much more bitter which is why orange juice in particular, which we know is normally very sweet, is really quite foul. There’s also menthol in there, and that has a temperature effect which fools your sensory nerves into being more sensitive to cold. So, fresh orange juice, fresh from the fridge may sound great and refreshing, will be good with your breakfast, but it’ll taste bitter and it will be painfully cold. Chris - I met someone a little while back who’s at the Oxford University. He’s a chemist and he showed me a wonderful trick with glucose because glucose comes in two 'handednesses'. There’s right handed glucose and left handed. What that means is, it’s a bit like if I had a glucose molecule and I put it in front of a mirror, you’ll have a molecule in one configuration in your hand, you’d have the molecule with its mirror image in the reflection. And nature is just the same. There are both forms of the sugar in nature. It just so happens that the human body uses the D-form, the right handed form. He brought with him some left handed glucose and I tasted it and guess what it tasted like? Ben - I have no idea. Chris - Do you think it’s sweet? Kat - Cherries. Ben - I’d assume it would be sweet because it’s the same atoms, isn’t it? Built into their molecule, just kind of reflected. Kat - No, if it can’t be recognized. Chris - No. It tastes like salt, which is salty. It was disgusting. It’s just a salty sort of (luhhrr) flavor. It wasn’t very nice at all because it’s the wrong shape to fit into the taste receptors on your tongue, just like Kat says. Ben - Wow!\",\n",

       "    \"I think the main misconception is that people believe our blood system was a circle. You know, you pump blood in the arteries and all the blod flows in a giant cucular path all arround your body until it reaches your heart again. If you cut a leg the path is broken and blood cannot flow anymore. If that was the case we had a big problem because that would mean if you cut a vein blood would pour out as if it was an arterie and you would die. Thankfully this is not the case. We have two seperate blood systems. The arterie which has overpressure and the vein system which has an underpressue. Cutting a vein open some will get out but due to the underpressue most of it will stay inside. If you cut an arterie you will see a fountain of blood and you have to apply pressure on the wound to keep the blood inside. So how this works is your heart pumps blood from your veins into your arteries system. This constant overpressure in the main arteries presses the blood through tiny paths in between all cells of your body. The underpressure in the veins sucks alll this blood into its system again. So instead of a giant circle you have many arteries and veins which are all dead ends creating over and underpressures. Attached to those dead ends are many many tiny tunnels acting like a web all across your body were the blood gets pressed into and sucked out again. The mechanism is much more simple than it sounds and you could easily rebuild it using a regular pump. Fun fact: Due to this overpressue effect your face for example slighly increases in size each time the heart pumps. It's hard to see with the human eye but a camera and a neat algorithm can see it.

Meaning blood doesn\\'t always follow a set path. one blood cell might make a full \"circulation\" of the system in 10 seconds by immediately being perfused to the heart and then expelled into the superior vena cava and find itself right back where it started. Another might end up in some stagnated blood in a varicose vein in someones leg and be stuck there for hours before eeking it\\'s way back to the heart. If instead of thinking of the circulatory system as a system that circulates blood, think of it as a three dimensional grid of pressurized pipes that generally flow in one direction. If you cut off some of the grid, the rest can still function relatively the same. That being said, I wouldn\\'t classify post amputation circulation as normal at all. Especially immediately after the amputation. over years, angiogenesis (the growing of new blood vessels) will re-construct a grid of pipes to create the best possible circulation. But that still wouldn\\'t be normal. We can also thank modern medicine for better techniques of surgical amputation. These days we understand in detail the anatomy of the vasculature, nerves, muscles, and have perfected techniques that maximize perfusion of the remaining tissue. If you had an amputation during the civil war when things were much more crude, altered circulation could cause tissue to necrose, and become gangrenous, killing you. If the surgical amputation was done in a way where you had better postoperative circulation in the area you might have survived. So, although there are some good reasons you can survive an amputation and have great perfusion in that limb after, the opposite could happen as well. Because of that, I can\\'t say that someone with an amputation has \"normal\" circulation in that area, although (especially with modern surgical techniques) they may well have excellent circulation.',\n",
       "    \"Know how you get to work even when some of the roads are closed or there's a traffic jam? That. Blood moves through your body based on pressure -- it is highest on the 'out' side of your heart, and then drops off the farther it gets from your heart. At many, many points along the way, blood is trying to find a way to get to a lower pressure area, and so it moves along from a network of arteries, through cells, and back into veins, where it is pulled back into the heart and recirculated again. Just like on our highways, some road closures have a big impact. It can starve that flow of blood so that there's not a way to get around fast enough to get into the tissues past the constriction. When that happens, the tissue dies. Think of muscles, fingers, toes, like neighborhoods, and your arteries and veins like highways. A road closure in a neighborhood isn't a big deal because there's a bunch of roads nearby, so it'll really only affect a couple of houses. But if a freeway or an offramp blows up, that entire neighborhood becomes inaccessible. All the blood (cars) will try to cram into the sidestreets to get in. Of course, it goes slower. A lot slower. Your circulatory system looks very much like our transportation networks do, and breakdowns look much the same way and happen for similar reasons.

If after the limb amputation the blood supply is lacking and the oxygen concentration in surrounding tissues falls below 1% the cells are said to be hypoxic (don't have enough oxygen). The cells recognise hypoxia and promote the secretion of a protein named vascular endothelial growth factor. In essence this protein (along with many others) induces the formation of blood vessels in tissues where the oxygen concentration is too low. An increase in vasculature results in increased blood flow to the area and thus the oxygen concentration in the tissues increases, eventually coming back to normal tissue oxygen concentration.

It\\'s reversible, of course... but it\\'s like this. If you had an iron plate and it scales apart into rust, and electrolytically turned the rust back into iron, it\\'s not a plate anymore, is it? Lead plates can be cycled about 300 times total. The material swells and contracts during discharge/recharge and slowly falls apart. It flakes off bits of lead, it cracks which disconnects a part of the plate from the terminal. There is a porous separator (a plastic or rubber mesh) between the positive and negative plates to allow them to be sandwiched very close to keep the resistance down, while separating them to prevent a short. Flakes shedding off pack into the separator and can poke through, resulting in a short. You might envision it as \"plating\" a new lead surface when it\\'s recharged. That\\'s not it- *the lead never moves in either plate*. The sulfide ion moves in and out of the electrolyte. The plate must be thin and porous on a molecular level (because each lead molecute can only react with electrolyte it\\'s in contact with, otherwise the lead is useless). You might think \"well we could glue the lead to fiberglass cloth to hold it together\" but the lead will still flake and crack apart and come off at about the same point. You might say \"well let\\'s make the lead plate like 1/4\" thick\" but then the battery would only have like 5% of the capacity it should for its size- and the shedding flakes off the plate surface will STILL clog the separator. People often ask \"well can\\'t I just wash out the old electrolyte with new and fix the battery\"? Well, each cell is like 200 plates of interleaved positive/separator/neg plates with flaked bits of plate packed into the separator. The flaked stuff is insoluble and can\\'t be washed out. Replacing the electrolyte fixes nothing. It can only be truly reformed by melting it back down and rolling it down into a new sheet during remfg. In the case of NiCd/NiMH/NiFe Edison cells (rare, used early 20th cent), it\\'s different- the plates don\\'t really break down. Rather, every time we charge them, the electrolyte loses a bit of water. In the typical sealed \"AA\" steel-can battery, there\\'s no surplus electrolyte, and no way to refill them. But there ARE very uncommon flooded-plate NiCd/NiMH/NiFe batteries which you can add distilled water to. I have a lot of vintage flooded-plate NiCd that work fine that I sell on eBay. These DO last basically forever. It\\'s crazy how long they last. But they do require maintenance and their charging cycle management is a bit crazy. The NiCd/NiMH/NiFe has one other enemy- carbonation. Regardless of whether they\\'re the sealed type or not. The electrolyte is a strong base (not acid) of potassium hydroxide. If exposed to air, it absorbs carbon from the small trace of CO2 in the air and forms potassium carbonate, which is chemically useless and charging doesn\\'t reverse that back into hydroxide. However... you CAN simply drain the electrolyte and mix up new KOH and refurbish the cell like-new again.']}},\n",

Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, “It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.”)  >  Snowden said that he would “love” to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, “I have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they’re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I’m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so. But they’ve declined.”  >  Instead, Snowden said, “They want to use special procedures. They want a closed court. They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.” So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn\\'t believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a \"show\" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently.',\n",

Someone else doing something illegal doesn't usually give you the right to also do something illegal. So it's entirely possible that while the NSA will be penalized for their actions, so will Snowden. And that's really the best case scenario, seeing as there *is* likely incentive for the government to protect the NSA. Or worse, there might be actual *justification* for the NSA's actions, which will seriously hurt any of Snowden's defenses.

Because of this, putting the wrong addresses on a letter is not abused very often, because it doesn't achieve much. For the same reasons, spoofing IP addresses is fairly uncommon, with the fix being to block individual addresses or address ranges manually on the receiver's side. To be fair, it would be easy to implement a similar mechanism for caller ID. For instance, you could simply tell your phone to block any calls from John Smith. But then the real John Smith can't call either. Same problem occurs with IP filtering. However, putting the wrong *name* on a letter might actually achieve something. Maybe you can trick the receiver into thinking the letter came from someone it didn't. So how do you make sure a letter came from the person it said it did? Certified mail. But, it's a pain in the ass and quite expensive because of all the extra steps involved, just as it would be for phone systems. To answer the question more directly, spoofed caller ID cannot be filtered because there is no mechanism for nonrepudiation. Mostly because it's complicated and expensive (usually this would required asymmetric crypto and a certificate authority). Caller ID spoofing is not a huge problem, so it's not worth the extra effort or expense.\",\n",

I\\'ll give you my experience of the other countries (so not At Will) as I used to interview, hire, and if necessary look into firing, employees for a company in the UK. As to why you don\\'t have it in the US, it\\'s just that it\\'s a different balance: One of the advantages of the UK system is stability. When I hired someone I knew they would not disappear from one day to the next. The month notice period (which is standard but can vary, and generally goes up with how much responsibility you have) means that from hearing that a worker is leaving it gave me a month to find replacements, make any adjustments and even do a handover with the new starter if necessary. For the employee it meant that they had the security of knowing they would not be out on the street from one day to the next, that they had at least a month\\'s worth of work from being told they were fired/made redundant. The negative of this notice period is that as a worker it\\'s sometimes hard to move into another job if they need someone else straight away or starting shorter than your notice period, because you are contractually obliged to stick out your period. Some people just leave anyway and depending on the position the company might just write it off (obviously they don\\'t pay them). Keep in mind that if your new employer finds out they may not look favourably on this at all as they\\'ll perceive you as being unreliable. It\\'s a misconception you can\\'t fire someone, it\\'s just that you have to follow a process. If someone starts a permanent position then both parties are agreeing to work with each other under the agreed terms of the contract. X amount of hours with Y responsibilities etc. Generally you have annual reviews, where goals are agreed on by both parties and then reviewed at the end of the year. This sets a framework for when you can or can\\'t fire someone, and generally lets both sides know where they stand. If I wanted to fire someone I would have to follow a specific process which generally involved identifying areas where the employee is not meeting the agreed standards, making that employee aware of the faults, giving them a reasonable chance to correct them, and then going from there. That said, this is for general performance. All contracts will have \"Gross Misconduct\" items that are instantly sackable. These are generally stated in the contract itself, and include things that you would expect like theft or any other crimes but may also include other company specific reasons. These reasons have to meet employment law standards so for example you can\\'t have \"dating a black person\" as a gross misconduct item. One of the major benefits for the workers in the above is that you shouldn\\'t (I say shouldn\\'t because things don\\'t always work out like this) ever have a situation where your boss can threaten people with getting sacked. Your boss can\\'t come in having a bad day and say something like \"next person to piss me off is getting fired\". You\\'d get sued into oblivion. One thing that I personally noticed, and this is now anecdotal, is that it was more common in the US offices to hear threats of \"someone\\'s going to lose their job over this\". Bosses don\\'t, at least in theory, have that ability to hold your job over your head like that. Either someone is committing a fireable offence or they are not, it\\'s not at the whim of someone having a bad day or with a bad temper. In addition to the above, companies can of course make people redundant. This addresses the issue some have brought up about a company having a right downsize when necessary. The thing is you don\\'t generally make people redundant, you make positions redundant. You can\\'t make your Assistant Art Director redundant and then just hire another one when he\\'s out the door, you have to kill that position entirely since your justification for the redundancy should be \"we can\\'t afford/no longer need that position\". There are more granular rules on this that I don\\'t want to state as fact without being sure, but there are time periods that have to go by for example. There are also mechanisms in place to ensure that things are being done fairly and not in a manner that breaks employment law. One thing to really take away is that it\\'s not just as simple as the government forcing companies to keep people on. It\\'s a complicated framework with mechanisms that protect both sides. If a company is finding it hard to fire someone then it can be their fault for the way they drafted their original contract or how they followed the process. I\\'ve had to go through the process of someone being dismissed and really it amounts to being able to say: \"This is what we agreed you would do. These are results showing you are not able or willing to meet these standards. Here are the things I\\'ve done as an employer to help you achieve these standards (this is so that you can\\'t place unachievable goals on someone and use that to fire them), here are results showing you still cannot meet standards. You\\'re sacked\". All the above happens internally with no government involvement at all. If the employee disagrees and takes you to court, that\\'s where the paper trail you created kicks into gear. And why is it like this? Because culturally that is what the people of the UK, in general, expect and demand. Both as employers and employees. It\\'s similar to how we have strong firearm laws in the UK yet nobody is protesting, because that\\'s how the people there want it. Personally I much prefer the system I was under in the UK. I had friends from the company move to the US and even had the chance to go, and turned it down because I do not feel the US system provides the sort of work environment I would want to work under. I understand why culturally Americans may prefer it, at least the employers, but it\\'s not for me. Really it\\'s like that for most people in the UK, and government policy reflects that. Personally I think that if Americans as a whole do not want government getting in the way of this then government is clearly not reflecting what Americans want. Don\\'t get me wrong, this obviously happens to some degree in the UK too, but maybe because it\\'s a much more homogenous culture and smaller population then it kind of works there. It\\'s a bit like how companies can leverage their power to get things they want, the people of the UK also have power and they choose to exercise it by having a system that works for them (since the majority of UK citizens are employees and not employers). I\\'m sure many companies in the UK would prefer the US system, but trying to do that in the UK would be political suicide for those in power. The above is written late at night and extremely simplified. I had a HR department that dealt with the finer details so it\\'s possible I got some details wrong or that is just doesn\\'t apply for all circumstances (well, I know it doesn\\'t as the laws vary according to many factors). Hopefully others can correct/add to what I said. TL;DR - Most people in the UK are employees and so they leverage what influence they have into having a system that is far fairer to the working person. This has been culturally accepted for so long that changing the paradigm would be quite hard. Who the hell would want less rights and security? Equally companies pull the other way. In the UK it\\'s fairly levelled between employee and employer. The US system seems to favour employers, which might make sense if you have a high number of small business or people aspiring to own a small business. Also culturally it seems people (US employees and employers) don\\'t feel the government represents what they want, so they try and keep them out of things. In the UK, with employment law at least, it\\'s not like that. That\\'s why we (and in general in Europe) have far better holidays and work conditions. Oh and I totally left out European laws that also come into play, but you should be able to get the gist. Why isn\\'t your system like that in the US? Because either your government is not reflecting what workers want, or that is what workers want.',\n",

       "  'output': {'14034': [\"I assume ELI5 actually means explaining like OP is 5. So I'll give it a shot. When someone says *passed down*, they typically mean transferring a trait from parent to child. There are 2 ways this can happen. **Environmental factors** (these are things that are *outside* the body. Like home-life, parent-child relationship, type of friends, role models, all that good stuff)  &  **Genetic factors** (things that are *inside* the body. Like genes and...well mostly just genes) The potential environmental factors are obvious, so I'll spare reddit the details. Genetic factors are a little more complex. You see, the mechanism of **addiction** is in the brain. But not just in a person's thoughts and/or feelings, but *literally* in the brain. In the pink tissue inside our skulls, there are tiny receptors (think of a baseball glove) that *catch* tiny neurotransmitters which are chemicals created and released *by* and *to* other brain tissue (think of tiny baseballs). Now, drinking alcohol, for most, makes a person feel good, right? When the brain feels good like this, it releases baseballs to their respective baseball gloves. However, overdoing this will cause the brain to create more baseballs than gloves. But the brain is basically a god-damned 3d printer. So it just creates more baseball gloves for the extra baseballs. Here's where the plot twist comes in, and where alcoholism rears it's head. These gloves don't *just* catch baseballs. They catch all kinds of balls as well, such as tennis balls (seizures), golf balls (hallucinations), and ping balls (death). An alcoholic, then, has to KEEP drinking alcohol to make the brain continue to release enough **base**balls to fill up the available gloves and to prevent these random other balls from entering the gloves. These gloves have always been able to catch these random balls, but since there was always a limited number of gloves, the chances of catching a tennis ball in the middle of a baseball field was always highly unlikely. So addiction comes down to too many gloves catching the wrong balls. Now, the most common way this happens is by the pathway mentioned above: a person drinking way too much and then causing the brain to make shitload a gloves. However, genetics has a role here too. There are some folks who's brain's 3d printer is way too efficient and is programmed to build more gloves quicker. In other words, in these folks it would take less drinks to cause them to become full blown alcoholics. Also, genetics can affect how *good* a glove can catch these other balls. So if you're brain's 3d printer is building Hyuuuge gloves, then obviously that person's glove will catch more random balls. Genetics can affect any part of that terrible baseball metaphor. I'd go on, but I'm sure you're getting the point. I think we've talked about balls enough today. **Serious Note**: So, no. It's not a sorry excuse for some people. It's a real disease. Hey, from personal experience, I know how problematic dealing with alcoholics can be, but they deserve empathy and patience. Some of them were just dealt a bad hand.\",\n",
       "    'The genetic variance for alcoholism is often estimated at 50-60%. Genetic variance, however, is a weird concept. Here\\'s an example I like a lot. Assume there\\'s only two things that influence lung cancer: Smoking, and genes. Now, let\\'s go to a city where literally everyone smokes, and 20% get lung cancer. Because smoking doesn\\'t vary, 100% of variance is due to genes. Sure, smoking actually caused it, but it doesn\\'t explain why some people got it and some didn\\'t. So genetic variance doesn\\'t tell us what most people think of when they hear that something is \"50% genetic.\" So what genetic variance tells us here is basically something you might observe anyway: Lots of people drink, and only a minority develop a strange and uncontrollable pattern of drinking. Some of this is explainable with genes, some with life history and environmental stressors, and some is mysterious. Questions of free will, I leave to the philosophers. What I can say is that alcoholics are not lacking in willpower--to the contrary, they\\'re capable of tremendous persistence. The problem is that it\\'s been progressively channeled towards getting another drink. Incidentally, while some gene variants increase risk for alcoholism, some actually decrease it.

Night after night, Americans would have the atrocities of war displayed in their living rooms. The Tet Offensive was a traumatizing affair - the United States Embassy under the attack from the Viet Cong was a traumatizing event for many who thought that the United States, as a world power, was untouchable. The escalation of the war (1965, half a million marines were sent) made it one of the biggest deployments since Korea.

After Nixon took over, this strategy changed and the South vietnamese got a lot more effective. They were able to repel a massive Northern Armored invasion in '72 with out american ground troops (but with american air support).

       "    \"I am going to disagree with /u/kparseyan. Obligatory mention here that I'm working towards a doctorate in English. You have to answer a question before you can even ask about this scenario: **what is language**? Obviously, written and spoken English/French/Chinese is a language. We all get that. But that doesn't really answer the question. We might also stipulate that, with no conscious thought (that we know of) plants don't speak a language. We can nail down both ends of the spectrum, but what you do with the middle is where the fun lives. What does language do? How does language work? Without getting super technical, language is a way of putting a symbol to a concept. The oldest adage about this is the word 'tree'. I say that word, you imagine a tree, but the tree you imagine might not be the same one in my head. We're not talking about a particular tree, we're talking about the concept of a tree. 'Tree' contains nothing. It is a symbol for a set of ideas. But even that's not enough. What language really does, its real power, comes in being able to differentiate between things. It's a relationship of various concepts, a network of ideas, that we separate out in taxonomies. What makes a tree a tree is that it is not a giraffe or a rock or a flower. What something is also implies what it isn't. The human brain, almost any brain, is capable of doing this. /u/kparseyan is incorrect when he says that, without language, you can understand sensations like hunger, pain, beauty....that's not true. Even if it isn't spoken or written, the brain has made a symbol for that sensation. There's an abstraction required, not to feel hunger, but to understand that the feeling is hunger and to act accordingly. Even without language, you'd be able to feel [gnawing hunger] and, probably by instinct alone, you'd be able to connect that feeling to satiation when you eat a sandwich. That's a language that is happening without words. That interaction relays a relationship between the feeling and the solution. That [hunger] is distinct from [sleepy] and [thirsty] and thus requires a different solution. When I feel [x] I identify it as distinct. Things can only be distinct things if I can tell they are different from other things. I need to be able to tell that hunger is different from thirst is different from pain is different from sleepy. Whether you put words or colors or pictures to those different sensations, you're creating a taxonomy of 'things' or 'concepts' that you identify as individual elements. Your brain, therefore, has a language with which to process those individual feelings. Even at the most basic level, you have to make the distinction of where you begin and the world ends. Seeing yourself an an individual, understanding that you are the 'I' is an an act of language. That written/spoken stuff is just a way for us to normalize symbols in social groups. It allows us to communicate our internal monologue with others. My ability to look at a tree and know it is different than a flower or a rock is happening by vision. My ability to talk to you about that time I fell out of a tree when I was six requires a set of symbols that you share with me, so I can relay abstract concepts reliably to another person.\",\n",

We have lots of evidence that if children aren\\'t exposed to language in their first few years of life, they never develop anything like normal human mental facilities. Symptoms of such deprivation are almost indistinguishable from organic brain damage: poor sense of self, mental retardation, lack of sense of time or ability to distinguish past, present and future, etc. Of course, it depends on the individual, and just how much, or little, exposure to language they had in the critical period before 6 or 7. There is some evidence from children abandoned and raised by animals, although that\\'s controversial because there are so few of them, and there is a question over whether they might have been abandoned because they were mentally retarded, or became mentally retarded because they were abandoned. There\\'s also evidence from a few cases where parents have neglected their children to such a degree that they never learned to speak, but the same question applies there. Probably the strongest direct evidence comes from children born profoundly deaf. In less enlightened times, or less knowledgeable times, being born deaf almost certainly condemned the child to becoming a deaf-mute, and another term for being deaf and mute is \"deaf and dumb\" -- it is no coincidence that the word dumb is used for both stupid and unable to speak. In times gone past, profoundly deaf children simply didn\\'t develop the same mental facilities as hearing children. Oliver Sacks describes a child, Joseph, who was born deaf but not diagnosed until he was four. With no attempt to teach the child any language at all, by 11 he suffered from a blank incomprehension, and lacked not just language but a sense of time. That was the fate of almost all children born deaf, until the 16th century when the Spanish monk Pedro Ponce de León taught the deaf son of a nobleman to read lips and speak. Prior to that, it was considered that those born deaf were hopeless cases. There\\'s another data point. In the 1880s, European educators made an incredible blunder. They voted to prohibit the teaching of sign language, from fear that it would leave the deaf isolated from the rest of society, and force the deaf to learn to speak oral language. The result was a disaster for the deaf -- by the 1950s, educational outcomes for deaf children were so poor that educators were wondering whether there might be something to the old Medieval theories that deafness was a form of brain damage.

This language\\'s basis would perhaps stem from memories of certain things that may be used to address particular needs. A brook would be something to sate his thirst, a cave for shelter, a stone would be something that can be used to crack open a nut, etc. His past experience of the world around him creates signifiers that can make sense of further experiences. If he once slipped on moss and sprained an ankle, then the next time he sees moss, he would take moss as a signifier of a slippery trail. On another note, there\\'d also be residues of baser animal instincts-- a wild animal hissing and baring its fangs, I imagine, would not need past experience as a prerequisite; it would probably immediately signify to our human, as it does to us, that he should stay away. I know this sounds as if our hypothetical human would not be much better, linguistically, than an animal, but again to run the risk of oversimplifying things, language (and the social advantages it creates) accelerates how we make sense of the world. Our hypothetical human could not be \"perfectly intelligent,\" because it\\'s language that creates the conditions for (the conventional understanding of) intelligence. Having a word for moss, and having that word \"moss\" mean the same thing to a community of humans, means that members of the community would not need to encounter moss per se (meaning, would not need to have a past experience of moss,) to learn that it would be slippery.

We know this because some song birds have about the same brain plasticy as humans. They have to learn their song from their parents, but if we take them away from their parents they will never learn their song and their bodies will never fully devolop.

But if you put a translational layer of software code on top of the CPU layer then the language makes more sense. The instructions (thoughts) are still the same, but the layer of translation between them is different (C vs Perl et al). But I\\'m not and expert in this.

When I say \"The boy hit the ball\", I know who hit what, what was hit, and what action took place connecting the who and the what. Language provides a way for us to keep track of not only those actions outside of our head, but our own thoughts within our head in a similar manner. It easier to think about deep, perplexing problems because we have the linguistic construct of the \"I\", \"me\" separate from the \"you\", \"her\", \"him\". Those without language certainly still have selves, but it is much harder for them to turn that into anything meaningful. It\\'s not just that our conclusions would be less meaningful, or simpler it\\'s that what problems and issues we are able to resolve are radically different without these linguistic constructs.

And as far as microbes go, there are very few of them that can tolerate ethanol concentrations anywhere near what's in wine. One of the few that can is yeast, which is what was used to make the wine in the first place. One of the others is a group of little critters referred to as acetobacteria, because they like to eat ethanol and make acetic acid, vinegar. So, if you do get a wine that's been contaminated with a microbe that will digest it, it will in fact go bad and turn into wine vinegar. Now, as far as aged wine being better, that depends. A lot of wines are still made using wild fermentation techniques, which means that the yeast they use isn't from some named and predictable package, it just happens to be whatever was floating around the vinter's yard that day or hanging out on the skins of the grapes. Those wild yeast can make some really awesome flavors. Or some really terrible ones. Fortunately, most of the terrible flavors tend to be rather unstable. So if you allow the wine to just sit around in a cool to slightly warm area (25*C would be pushing it), the unstable compounds will break down and the flavors will mellow. If you get it too hot, the wine will basically cook and too much of the flavor will disappear. If you keep it too cold, the wine will take a very long time to age and some of the nasty flavors will probably never disappear. You also want some of those ostensibly unpleasant flavors to stick around. They help provide complexity to the flavor profile and can balance out any residual sweetness from sugars that the yeast didn't convert into alcohol. This means that there's a sweet spot in the age of a wine where it's at it's best. When this range is will depend on the wine. Sweeter whites tend to peak in a few months, as they have a lot of residual sweetness and very little tannin to balance it. Dry reds tend to peak in a few years, since they have a lot of tannin and very little sugar to balance it.\",\n",

       "    \"it's routine, which means you're going to do it anyway. there's nothing that needs to 'spur' a visit to the dentist. you need your teeth deeply cleaned at regular intervals, or your teeth will rot and fall out. yes, you need a checkup at regular intervals... but your typical checkup will result in a doctor spending a small amount of time with you and maybe he finds something that needs to be taken care of. probably not, though. it's much more common that a dentist will find a cavity. with that... it's predictable, which means people tend to have the same issues at similar intervals. pretty much everyone, with few exceptions, will need a cavity filled, a tooth pulled, and/or a root canal, every so often. compare that to emergency medical ailments, like appendicitis or tonsilitis. those are rare compared to, say, a wisdom tooth pulled... and those are some of the most common emergency ailments that need to be taken care of by medical professionals. it's expensive to deliver. not only do dentists have to sink in thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars into training, but they have a lot of regular expenses (cleaning solution, replacement heads and picks, office staff, computer systems, licensing... list goes on). not to mention a fair amount of overhead (all that stuff in your dentist's office is really expensive, i'm talking 5-7 figure machines). now, medical care is also expensive to deliver... but medical care can range from an hour of a doctor's time, to millions of dollars to perform multiple surgeries, maintain treatment, and keep you housed in a top-notch facility for months and months. not only that, but this kind of ailment does NOT happen to everybody. in fact, it's not even close. combine all these factors and it simply makes no sense to insure. now, let's say you're not aware of how insurance works. insurance is a business by which people pay a regular fee in order to not have to worry about a big fee caused by some sort of emergency. cars, homes, and human bodies have insurance. so why doesn't your mouth have insurance that's fully covered? well, the reason is mainly because of the profit motive. insurance companies want to make money, so they're essentially betting on a healthy person living to 80 without any real complications. your typical healthy person will have a few health problems, then one serious health problem at the end of their life (which, in turn, kills them). this doesn't work very well with dental because of the reasons listed above. dental insurance is not that good of a bet because insurance, in itself, is expensive. insurance companies are very expensive to run, and that causes an added cost overall on your health care plan. on top of that, insurance companies want to make a profit. so, if all of dental care were insured, it would be prohibitively expensive to the average person. might as well just pay for the cleanings with some sort of subscription and deal with the cost of a root canal (which is not a $25,000 procedure and doesn't require a lengthy hospital stay... but is still expensive to deliver and routine enough to expect most people to deal with this in their lives.) compare that to medical insurance where the company makes a bet that any given person will NOT have to have a $1 million surgery. so they charge each of them, say, $1000/yr. if 1 in 1000 have this $1 million surgery, then they break even. however, the insurance company determines that the ratio is far less than 1 in 1000. this, in a nutshell, is why dental care insurance doesn't cover everything. however, your question was about socialized health care schemes, where we all dump some money into the health care scheme via our taxes and pay nothing up front for our care or insurance. this goes back to the 'prohibitively expensive' thing. for a government to offer free dental entirely, they would generally want to integrate it into their health insurance scheme. this, though, would result in a tax increase roughly the cost of dental insurance. tax increases are almost never popular. and the marginal benefit of a tax increase for dental care is quite low. might as well have people elect for the kind of dental care they want and not have to invest the resources to have the government take care of it. hope this helps.\",\n",
       "    \"Dentistry is its own profession, distinct from medicine, mainly for historical reasons. A Frenchman, Pierre Fauchard, is thought to have really got modern dentistry started back in 1728. That's over a century before doctors generally accepted that germs cause disease, for example. As for why it's not funded, it's down to what the government decided. In the UK specifically, changes made in 2006 led to the government not adequately paying dentists for NHS work. In particular those changes mean that a dentist would receive no more money for a 'course of treatment' involving several fillings than they would for a single filling. This has resulted in many former NHS dentists switching to only treat patients on a private basis.\",\n",
       "    \"Something to note is that along with all the other reasons, dentists lobby to make ensure that dentistry isn't covered. Dentists make a lot of money because dentistry isn't covered under universal health care. When negotiating a price between seller(dentist) and buyer(person with tooth problems) the dentist has a lot of power and can charge a price favourable to them. If we were to replace the buyer with the government instead of the person with tooth problems, the buyer gets a lot more negotiating power than if it were an individual person.\",\n",

Charges vary in different countries of the UK.'\"]}},\n",

One high school has 200 students in the student body. The other high school has 4000. Even though there are only 11 players on the field per team at any given time in a football game, the 4,000 student school's team will likely be better because it has a larger talent pool to draw from. Competition also plays a factor. Most of the time, men and women don't see themselves directly competing. When you're better than everyone else you see yourself competing with, it's hard to push yourself further. Think of if you're in high school running a mile race. You run it in 5 minutes and all of your competitors run it in 7 minutes. Clearly your better than your competition, but had you been running against people who can also run it in 5 minutes, your time would likely have been faster because you were being pushed.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm breaking the rules by speculating...And you might want to x-post this to AskScience, but here's my stab at it: Obviously men's greater average strength and stamina factor heavily in most sports. Males also have denser and stronger bones, tendons and ligaments. Men also have higher peripheral pain tolerance. In general, men also have better spatial reasoning and hand-eye coordination. Another big factor could be testosterone...Testosterone makes people more competitive.\",\n",

       "    \"Biology Guy, reporting in again. It's not every single sport. But you have a valid point. Here's why! Scientists can scan to see what part of the brain is working when you do a task, or think of something. We know from medicine in a general way what parts of the brain do what. They found that men and women use different parts of the brain for the exact same tasks sometimes. Now, the part of the brain that men use more than women , the scientists and doctors know that part has to do with how we think of the locations of things. (How objects orient themselves in space, ELI12) Men almost always perform better on tests that involve this type of thing too. Lots of sports require quick brain work on where to run to, or how to place your feet when you dive into the pool, or other things like that. So often, even in cases where a man and woman are the same size, weight, and have the same amount of practice for some sport, in lots of cases the women comes out a little bit short. It's valid to note that it really depends on the sport. There are very small differences between what a man can do and a woman can do in some sports (0.8 seconds difference between some sprint world records). Other sports have massive differences. Even the greatest female tennis player that has ever lived would be very hard pressed to beat the 300th ranked best male tennis player. [See this and related articles for info.]( URL_0 )\",\n",

       "    \"I've put adult parts in square brackets. Well Little Jimmy, from my understanding this stems from two reason. The first: You know how the boys in your school like the girls and sometimes you'll do things to try to impress them [part of natural selection]. This happens a lot for boys (and men) and because of that there is a much larger number of males doing these physical activities than there are women (who typically try to impress guys in other ways [like looking healthy with makeup and fertile with bras and hair dye]). Because there are so many more men doing these things there are more people who can be excellent at it, ATribeCalledGreg describes this quite well, and also there is a lot more competition among men which pushes them to perform better. [More reading: * URL_0  * URL_2 ] The second: This one is a lot more controversial and actually describes a situation where men are generally both better AND worse than women at these things. Back when humans just started existing people had to evolve to survive. When humans evolved they didn't just automatically become better, each time a child was born it had a chance to be less good or more good than it's parent. What would happen then is the best children would have more babies with better partners and the less good ones would have less babies (if they got to have babies at all). This would happen over and over again and over time there were more and more better children. If children didn't become less and more good [mutate] this whole thing would not have worked [evolution]. There is a theory that this was more important to men because we are the ones that have to impress women (like we talked about before). What this means is that every time a baby boy is born it has a bigger chance to be better and a bigger chance to be worse but a lower change to be average [standard deviation is higher]. [More reading:  URL_1 ] TL;DR: There are a lot more men doing these sports because of our evolutionary need to impress women through physical activities and the standard deviation for men's performance at most things in life is much larger than that for women (i.e. men tend to be both better and worse than women at most things where women tend to be more average).\",\n",

It affects how he acts and thinks. But not somebody else. You get to practice your faith, but you don\\'t get to demand other people obey the requirements of your religion. Religion is a personal choice. 3 . Marriage is two different things. There\\'s the religious thing, in the church, with the priest, the ring, and the pretty dresses, and the hilariously large cake. You know, all the Hollywood stuff. And then there\\'s the thing the government does. That\\'s a filing fee, a couple of witnesses and a couple of signatures. Romantic it ain\\'t. Legal it is. Every time you read something about gay marriage rulings in the news, and all the court decisions. They are talking about option two. That\\'s the one you have a Right to. Its a government service. People opposed to it try to talk like they are the same thing in an attempt to make the issue about religion, or the government forcing a religion to do something. Its not. Gay people have a right to walk into a government office and apply for a Marriage license. That church down the street being a religious institution still has the right to refuse to let them have their party with the cake and things there. Government employees have another problem. The government is forbidden from having a religious opinion. So someone acting on behalf of the government is also forbidden from having a religious opinion *while on duty*. The Davis court rulings made that really clear, Kim Davis is not entitled to First Amendment protections (Just like you may speak your mind, you may not be forced to speak things that you do not believe) for speech arising from her duties as County Clerk. Government Officers actually lose a bunch of rights while on duty, because people are given a lot more protections than the Government gets, and the Government is straight up not allowed to do some things. This is the only part where Religion meets Law and there is a direct conflict, because a Government job requires them to do things, and Government isn\\'t allowed to do or not do something for religious reasons, so a religious person has to choose between their religion and their job if they conflict. But that brings it right back to the personal choice.',\n",

I mean REALLY believe, not like you just go to church or think of a \"higher power\" or something. It isn\\'t your hobby or some small part of your life. You REALLY believe that an all-powerful God made you, sent his son to die for you, and at the end of every person\\'s life will judge them as worthy or unworthy. The worthy will be sent to live forever in perfect bliss, while the unworthy will be tortured in such profound and horrible ways that you can\\'t even begin to imagine it. All God asks is that you love him and follow some simple rules. Maybe you find it hard to love him - to truly and freely do what you absolutely have to do - but at least you can follow the rules. And everyone else is in this situation too, so you better help them follow the rules. It doesn\\'t matter if they don\\'t want to, or don\\'t believe, or were \"born different\", you are literally saving their eternal soul by helping them - by any means necessary - follow the rules. So, freedom of religion means you are allowed to do this. Allowed to make damn sure everyone follows the rules so that they don\\'t burn in hell for eternity. A human-made government or popular opinion is completely meaningless compared to the judgement of God and the suffering of eternal hell. Of course the government gives you this freedom. They have no choice, you\\'d make people follow the rules whether they wanted you to or not, but it is good that we set up a government that allows us - freely - to enforce God\\'s rules. Now, if the government were to go and condone something that directly violates God\\'s rules, well now that just can\\'t stand and you\\'d do anything to fight it. Because it is impinging your freedom to save people from hell. But also, the bigger issue, is that you\\'d do literally anything - anything - to save people because the cosmic stakes are far more important than any earthly rule or government.

You want it, and it will make you happy, but Dad knows that it will turn out badly for you. He does what is best for you even if you don\\'t realize what is best for you. Now imagine that the government passed a \"fluid equality\" act that allowed everyone to drink radiator fluid whenever they wanted. Dad would probably think that it interfered with his freedom to raise his kids. AGAIN NOT SAYING THAT GAY MARRIAGE IS EQUIVALENT TO DRINKING RADIATOR FLUID, but if you believe in eternal hell and suffering then actually it is much worse (one only kills your body, the other damns your soul).',\n",

Besides that, being naturally coordinated would help controlling the muscles which keep a steady pitch or vibrato or volume, being naturally gifted in pitch and tone differentiation would be important(good ear, perfect pitch), and because IMO natural abilities get a little too much credit with the general public, a natural patience, memory, intelligence, passion and persistence would all be very important when it comes to learning and practicing.

You then need to steer into your fall, e.g. if you fall to the left you must steer to the left. This causes your weight to shift to the right and therefore will put you back in balance. These mini falls are constant while riding a bike and while they exaggerated at first soon they become minor and easy to correct. Your brain works out how to do this without thinking about it. As a small child, learning to ride a bike is harder and to understand this explaination is hard too as it probably took you several weeks to learn how to ride just from trial and error, and basically your brain worked it for you without your conscience mind ever having to understand it.

       "    \"check out this paper:  URL_0  I did my final year engineering project partially on bicycle stability. This is a linearized model, so it does make some simplifying assumptions, but I think it does a good job of pointing out the nature and complexity of the truth. (we're getting pretty far away from an explanation a five year old can understand at this point) It's just highly complex. If you don't understand multivariable differential equations and systems theory, you're going to have a bad time understanding what keeps a bicycle upright. It stays up because of a complex, coupled relationship between (principally) three variables along with physical properties of the bike: steering angle, leaning angle, velocity, and the various masses and moments of inertia of the parts. Simply writing down Newton's law (F=ma) and the conservation of angular momentum yields a big fat second order linear multivariable differential equation of these variables. The most interesting part of this vector equation emerges when the equation is eigendecomposed--that is, the variables are grouped in new proportions with each other to produce a similar vector (representing the same variables) but is treated nicely by the matrices in the equation. These vectors, which are combinations of the three variables, represent the coupled modes of motion that the bike undergoes. The death wobble is a phenomenon most people encounter at some point when riding a bike. The death wobble is an eigenvector--it's a time-dependent combination of the three variables which satisfies the differential equation. This is necessarily a complex eigenvalue because it is an oscillating mode. The real part of the eigenvector dictates whether the magnitude of the oscillations increases (positive feedback) or decreases (negative feedback). Here's a video of a death wobble increasing in magnitude  URL_3  Here's a video of it decreasing in magnitude  URL_2  This is a good example of a self stable bicycle. (It's in the second half of the video) So it's about the real part of the eigenvalue. This dictates whether oscillations will amplify, or decay over time. When the real part is negative, perturbations from stability tend to decay back to stable, when they're positive, perturbations from stability tend to amplify. Here are the eigenvalues vs. bicycle velocity:  URL_1  Past the point where they're all negative, the bike is self-stable edit: clarification edit2: that is not my paper\",\n",
       "    \"So, this is some basic physics. Keep in mind that it's easier to balance on a bike as you're moving faster. Torque is basically the force of a rotating object, and it's dependent on how fast the wheel is spinning. So, if something is spinning faster (like a bike wheel), it has more torque. The torque points in a direction perpendicular to the wheel. The bike tipping over would change the direction of this torque, since the wheel would be pointing a different direction. Since it requires more force to change the direction of the torque when the wheel is moving quickly, it's harder for the bike to tip over. This is also why it's easier to ride a bike with no hands when you're going fast. **tl;dr magic**\",\n",
       "    \"Late entry here. It's because a moving bicycle has negative feedback - as you try to push over a bicycle, it pushes back. When you start falling over on a bicycle, you push the top of the frame of the bicycle to the inside. The frame then pushes on the front wheel in front of the center of the wheel, which causes the front wheel to turn inside. The turned front wheel then pushes on the ground below the center of the bike in the opposite direction of the fall, which tries to right the bike. I remember reading about a custom built bicycle which had the frame connect to the front wheel behind the wheel's center, which took out this feedback loop. It was impossible to ride.\"]}},\n",

Basically he said that Newton\\'s Laws are valid in all inertial reference frames, that is ones that are not accelerating. So what this means is that if I\\'m in a car going a constant 20mph and a car is approaching me at 30mph, we could assume that MY car is standing still and their\\'s is approaching at 50mph. At the time what he was really saying is \"The laws of physics are valid in all inertial reference frames,\" as Newton\\'s laws were, more or less the laws of physics as far as we knew. So in come a few people: Gauss, Ampere, and Faraday who develop some really important laws governing electricity and magnetism. A fellow named Maxwell expands on their work and realizes that--with some tweaking--their results combine to four very elegant laws explaining how charged bodies move and how magnets work, also that they are very closely linked (you\\'ve probably heard the term *electromagnetism*, yes we physicists view them as two sides of the same coin). Maxwell combines their results into a set of laws called \"Maxwell\\'s Equations.\" One of the equations implies that changes in a magnetic field create and electric field and vice-versa. One of the RESULTS of Maxwell\\'s equations is that light travels at a constant speed, which we could now calculate with these equations. Now in come the quantum physicists of the early 20th Century. They realize that light is a just a propagating change in the electric and magnetic fields. So Einstein wonders, \"if light is just the electric and magnetic fields changing, what would happen if we \\'ran\\' next to light at the same speed? We don\\'t see the changes in the field (aka the light) and there should be no light when we run alongside it (this is a clumsy way of saying with words what he said with math).\" So Einstein is REALLY perplexed by this. Next he thinks \"If all the laws of physics were the same in all inertial frames back in Galileo\\'s day, why shouldn\\'t the same be true for Maxwell\\'s equations.\" Remember that from Maxwell we can DERIVE the speed of light. So Einstein decides THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS A LAW OF THE UNIVERSE. That is, no matter how fast we move, light moves at the same speed! That takes a moment to digest so think about it. Say I\\'m running away from you at 5mph and you\\'re standing still. A photon (light particle) runs between us; WE BOTH SEE IT MOVING AT THE SAME SPEED! Now what is speed? It is distance over time. You saw the photon move some distance X, I saw it move some distance that was more than X. But we saw it move at the same speed! How is that possible? If and only if a clock in my pocket was ticking slower than a clock in your pocket! Edit: Let me say explicitly, **the faster you are moving, the slower a clock moving at the same speed will tick.** Also, grammar. Physics man...',\n",
       "    \"It seems as though people aren't really understanding Fuck_my_username's response so I'll give a simple (and common) way of understanding it. Imagine two people. Person A is on a train, Person B is next to the train track. Inside the train, next to Person A is a table with a torch (flashlight) on it pointing at the roof. Now imagine the train is moving from left to right, where does the light go? Well, just as Fuck_my_username explained, saying the train is moving at 10 kph to the right, is the same as saying the Earth moved at 10kph to the left. So when the guy on the train looks at the light he sees it go straight up and hit the roof. Lets say that that distance is 1 metre. However what does the guy next to the moving train see? He sees that even though the light went up and hit the roof, because the train is moving to the right, the light slightly moved to the right too. Imagine throwing a tennis ball up in the car, it goes straight up and straight down to you, but to someone outside they saw that ball move very fast to the right (as it was thrown up) given your car is moving very fast to the right. So therefore for the person outside the train the light travelled a longer path. The speed of light is constant. Therefore less time elapsed for the guy inside the train than for the guy outside the train. ---- If diagrams are needed I can probably make some.\",\n",

Now on the paper I'm going to draw two arrows, pointing away from each other at 90 degrees, like this, see? * ^ * | * | * | * x - - -  >  Now down here at the X is where we're going to put the sticky note arrow. The up arrow represents velocity through space, or how fast we're moving. The right arrow represents velocity through time how fast time is moving. So if we point our sticky note all the way towards time, you see that it's not pointing at velocity at all! So all of our velocity is going towards moving forward in time. Now if we rotate it a little bit towards the up space arrow, it's pointing less at *time* and more at *space*. Now we're moving mostly through time, but also a little bit through space. Imagine we're on the Enterprise. What, you don't know what that is? It's a spaceship that can go close to the speed of light. If we were on the spaceship and started going the speed of light, look what happens here, we're moving mostly through space, but now only a little bit through time. Moving through space and moving through time are linked like this, you have a maximum velocity that you can move, and you have to split that between time and space. Now light particles, or photons, always travel at the speed of light, because they are light. See how they're pointed all the way at the 'space' arrow and none at the 'time' arrow? This shows us that photons don't move through time at all, only through space. Meaning, photons don't experience time at all. From their view, the moment they are created is the same moment they are destroyed. Because we're not moving at the same speed as photons, we can watch them move and see them moving through time. That's because we're not able to move our arrow all the way over to pointing at space. Why? Well it takes a lot of force to move this arrow. Right now we can only move the arrow a tiny tiny little bit. Just enough that we can notice a time speed difference between the ground and a satellite in orbit. Maybe someday we can figure out a way to make our arrow go farther, but right now it's too hard to make that happen. *Really low level, but does that make a bit more sense than the other examples on here?*\",\n",

You have a limited amount of decisions you can make in a day before they just become harder and harder and harder to make. This is why managing a group of people can be so exhausting too.

At sea level, the human body is at its natural athmospheric pressure. However, at 37,000 feet the air gets considerably thinner, even inside airplanes. Much like with the stress ball, this lowers athmosperic pressure and the expands gases and some liquids in the human body (this is why we fart a lot in airplanes).

A lot of the exhaustive feeling comes from your body, usually, being subjected to an atmosphere of relative discomfort. Each person has their own personal threshold for what discomfort is but what is shared is that these discomforts generate stress upon the body. The brain, as a counter, therefore uses up a lot of energy and resources to cope with the added stress of the environment (I would honestly argue though that a wide majority of cases of these issues stems from the lack of sleep when in a not-so-greatly accommodating transport system). My personal example: I used to ride the train a bunch (AmTrak) which is essentially 4-5 hours of constant rocking back and forth. The first couple of times, I was super tired afterwards because I couldn't sleep and I could just feel my psyche actively trying to block out the annoyance of the rocking and the stress it was causing.

One of the topics they discussed was that: *Hey, its fucking hard to sue individual copyright infringers because there are so many of those bastards and none of them have money! Our important citizens/copyright holders/lobbyers are asking us implement some law that allows them to sue those guys who enables mass infringement and have deep pockets to sue while making it easy for us as we only need to sue one person.* So they agreed to say that anyone who *authorises* infringement (secondary infringement) is just as guilty as the people who commits it (aka primary infringement). But it was really up to each individual country to adopt that agreement into local domestic legislation with their precise wording. Just because you sign an international agreement, it wont come into effect until you make legislation for it. Typically, the way most cases have interpreted this vague word is that if they had some combination of the following factors: * the defendant had technical control to prevent infringement and did nothing about it to prevent it or even turned a blind eye (or even worse, actively promoted it which is what piratebay pretty much did) * it would have been very easy (ie not a lot of time and money) for the defendant to control/prevent infringement * they were made aware of the infringing activities * their business model was reliant on heavy usage of infringing activity (ie legitimate use was minimal compared to illegitimate use) For example, a famous case in Australia called iiNet where the ISP was sued for this reason, they satisfied everything except for the fact that they could not easily prevent all those infringing activities. The Piratebay creator was probably one of the most easiest cases to find that it was illegal under authorisation out all of the authorisation cases in history. Taking him to prison is something that the international agreement didnt require each country to do - the addition of criminality must have been added by the jurisdiction he was found guilty for.',\n",

       "    \"Hello, I work in a psychology research lab studying sleep and memory, so this isn't exactly what I work on, but I feel its close enough that I can give an educated answer. There are a number of interactions that lead to your observation, but the simple answer is that they aren't functioning fine, they only appear to be. With the right measures, a person missing only 1 hour of sleep can easily be identified. First, its important to distinguish between functioning fine after one night of only a few hour's sleep and repeated nights of only a few hour's sleep. While its possible to function relatively normally with one night of little sleep, repeated nights of little sleep will build a sleep debt in 99.9% of people. Your body will start prioritizing different sleep cycles as you become more indebted, and when you finally have the opportunity to catch up, you'll find your self sleeping 10-12 hours. Its also important to know that its not a straight 1-1 ratio of sleep debt to sleep catch up, and you'll often need more nights of catch up sleep than you missed. Second, your body has two sleep clocks that are used to determine if you are tired. The first is based on how long its been since you were asleep. While your awake, a chemical (melatonin) is released that slowly builds up in your body. The more of this chemical you have built up, the more the urge to sleep grows. When you do go to sleep, the chemical build up reverses and the clock resets. The second clock is based on light exposure which is normally anchored to the night day cycle. In the morning, when your body detects an increase of light, it releases a different chemical (cortisol), that works to prepare your body for action. If these two clocks get desynced, it can lead to a state where you feel energized because its time to be awake, but your body still needs more sleep. This is often the case with frequent nappers, the melatonin build up was not completely reset because they did not get enough sleep. The third reason people may not notice they need more sleep is that the part of the brain that is responsible for judgement (prefrontal cortex) is one of the first parts of the brain to be affected by lack of sleep. Simply put, you've lost the ability to accurate tell how tired you are. There is a similar effect that occurs when people drive drunk. They are too drunk to realize how drunk they are and so they make judgement that there safe to drive. Finally, people can seem to function fine with little sleep because we are rarely pushed hard enough to notice. You might feel like this is an argument towards not needing sleep, but in certain situations, your lack of sleep will become painfully obvious. Take for example an ER doctor who has only slept for 2-3 hours each night for the past few days. It might seem like he is doing fine since it would be obvious, and dangerous, if we wasn't, but most of his job is automatic. If a person comes in with a gun shot wound, the steps to save this person's life are already procedure and the physical motions are well practiced. Where you do see these doctors make life threatening mistakes, is in situations that require attention like prescribing conflicting medications or responding to atypical situations. Another example is a student who stays up all night partying and then aces a test the next morning. Recall is relatively easy, so if you were well rested when you learned the material, you should be fine, but learning new material while sleep deprived can be impossibly difficult. **Edit** Another point to consider is that many people get more sleep than they claim. Studies have been done where people are hooked up to a machine that measures brain activity (EEG) and then asked to push a button if they had been asleep when a buzzer sounded. The buzzer went off at different time intervals (1min, 5min, 10min, etc.) after they have fallen asleep according to the EEG, or randomly while still awake. Some participants who had slept up to an hour claimed that they were not asleep when the buzzer went off. Now at the begining, I said this was true for 99.9% of people. There are case studies of a family who only sleeps about 2-3 hours a night, every night. When given memory/alertness/health measures, they perform about the same as people who have gotten the standard 8 hours. Last I knew, the mechanisms of this were not understood, but given that it is most likely genetic, as it runs families, I think its easy to imagine that some lesser form of these genes could be at work in the average population. Not everyone needs 8 hours. Some need more and some need less, but it is incredibly rare to be healthy outside of 7-9 hours of sleep. If you think your one of these people, its much more likely that you've been tired for so long, you think its normal. TLDR: The vast majority of people can't function well on a few hours of sleep for multiple nights, they only appear to be. You can go a while with little to no sleep, but you will need to catch up eventually. There are extremely rare cases of families only needing 2-3 hour sleep. No one knows why this is yet. You are not one of these people!\",\n",

       "  'output': {'4085676': [\"It's a complicated answer with a few causes so I will try to go over a few. Insurance premiums are high because costs to insurance companies are high. These costs come from a few sources. Hospitals do not refuse ER treatment to the uninsured and when those people default on the HUGE bills, the hospital must just deal with that. Because of this, people who CAN pay (insurance companies), must pay extra for the hospital to break even/ make a profit. This is only a small part of the story, though. Costs are high because doctors get paid a lot. Not that they do not deserve a high salary, but the cost of *becoming* a doctor is incredible. Due to this, a high salary is required to pay off the mountains of debt each doctor is likely in from getting an education. Costs are high because of pharmaceutical companies charging thousands of dollars per dose of lifesaving medication. Insurance companies try to encourage people towards generics because it costs much, much less to them. Let's say you need Pill A to live. Pill A is a name brand which costs $1,00 per dose. There is a generic version of Pill A available at only $200 per dose and it works just as well. Your doctor may not know what the actual cost of Pill A is, and he prescribes it to you. You have an option to go with a generic but many people prefer a name brand. Co-Pays exist to encourage you to choose alternatives like generics. Let's say you have a $100 co-pay on Pill A, but only a $5 co-pay on the generic. This is your insurance company's way of encouraging you to the cheaper option. If you choose the generic, your insurance company has to pay the other $195 that is left after your co-pay. That sounds like a lot still, but it's still better for them than having to pay the other $900 left for the name brand Pill A. Costs are high because of malpractice insurance. Suing for medical malpractice is surprisingly easy, and because of this, doctors have to pay for insurance in case it happens to them. Whether it is a good or a bad thing is irrelevant: these costs are passed on to the consumer. Costs are high because of how insurance works on a fundamental basis. Young, healthy people are MUCH less likely to actually make claims on their insurance. Old/sick people are MUCH more likely to go to the hospital and therefore they make more claims to the insurance company. The insurance company needs to have a LOT of young, healthy people paying every month to have enough money to pay for sick people as well as make a profit. This is called the insurance 'pool'. The larger the pool is, the lower the costs can be for each person in the pool. A big insurance company has more healthy people paying in, which mitigates the costs of the fewer number of sick people. There are other reasons at all, but it's impressive that a 5 year old is in a micro econ class.\",\n",
       "    \"It's high for these reasons (not listed in any particular order): * Medicaid and Medicare insist on lower rates. Hospitals and doctors need to get that money back somehow, and hey do so by charging everyone else higher rates. * Some people don't pay health insurance, but still end up getting services for free. Hospitals and doctors need to get that money back somehow, and they do so by charging everyone else higher rates. * Many other countries regulate health prices low enough that companies only turn profits based on products sold in the USA. In other words, the USA is subsidizing the rest of the world. * There is little regulation of costs in the USA. Health care is not a regulated utility like electricity or natural gas often is. It is also not fully government managed. * People are removed from the actual costs of health decisions. There's an attitude that you should be able to go anywhere, get 5-star health service, and only pay a copay of $25. So doctors can frequently charge what they want, and insurance often pays a large portion of it. * It is near impossible to go shopping for health procedures by price. If you are uninsured, and you call around to various places and ask prices for a simple visit or a simple procedure, nobody will tell you a price. People don't ask this, and thus people don't know how to provide it. * In some markets, there isn't enough competition between health providers and/or insurance. In those markets, health costs go up. (I happen to live in the Ogden-Clearfield Utah area, which was just rated #1 in lowest health costs. We have a handful of options, which drives costs down. It's still expensive, but half the nationwide average.) * Some insurance is for profit. Their profit margin is very small (say, 3%), but that 3% does add on top of existing health costs. * Studies have indicated that malpractice lawsuits add roughly an additional 2% that is perhaps frivolously large. * The medical world in the USA feels in some sense entitled to high salaries. Becoming a specialist is an easy way to pull in a $200k salary. Anesthesiologists often make much more than that. There's very little pressure to make those salaries smaller. * There is more demand for skilled medical professionals. And the way people become licensed is heavily regulated and restricted. * The USA largely functions on an employer sponsored insurance model, and it's heavily regulated, insisting that insurance must cover a wide range of things. This also heavily hides costs and choice from consumers. * It costs a massive amount of money to research, test, and approve a pharmaceutical drug. Those drugs only get a short life span before generics can come in and effectively steal the market away. So those new drugs often seem ridiculously expensive. * Our society is fat. * Our society is unhealthy. The recent passed health legislation (The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) does little to reform these costs to make them better. What it focused on instead is increasing regulation so that insurance covers more things. It also subsizes the employer sponsored health insurance model. It also expands the role of Medicaid. It obtains lower health care costs by raising taxes on the rich, and redistributing that money to help pay for insurance to anyone making $80,000 or less, on a sliding scale, (if the individual does not want employer sponsored insurance).\",\n",
       "    \"Insurance agent here: Looks like you've got a TON of debate as to reasons why. I'll give you the reasons I've run into working mainly with healthcare industries and professionals. 1. The US is pretty damn unhealthy. 33% obesity? It's insane. 2. Medical professionals face *incredible* expenses. Not just the cost of education, but equipment, business operations, and especially the insane expense of malpractice insurance. Which brings me to: 3. Rapid expansion of lawsuits. Whether the vast number of medical related lawsuits is warranted or not, I'll not comment. But the sheer number means every doctor can expect to be named in a suit at least a couple times in their careers. 4. Large aging population. The baby boomers are hitting their unhealthy years and the price is passed on to the consumer base in general. 5. Insurance company greed. This is not a real strong contributor, since many small groups try to create health care 'pools' or 'clubs' where they share the cost of each others' health care and find that they're paying just as much as they would for a traditional health insurance plan. 6.

You aren't raping a person by having sex with a drunk girl. What's rape is when a girl has had so much booze that she doesn't understand what is happening, can't make decisions at all, and is basically passed out. This means she is physically unable to consent because she doesn't understand she is having sex and couldn't say yes or no if you asked. People act like the law is that women can cry rape if they wake up and regret the beer goggles. This isn't the case. it's very clear when a person is too drunk to consent and more than that, long before you get to that point they are too drunk to have enjoyable sex, or for you to enjoy the sex (edit: More than you would with a sex doll). Most normal people wouldnt want to have sex wifh someone approaching that level. So really, if you aren't into having sex with immobile people the issue should never come up. So the answer to your question is, it depends on how you are defining you terms. As is, the woman is sexually assaulting a minor.

Depending on how drunk the girl was, the 14 year old boy MAY be charged with rape if the girl was so drunk that she could not consent. Statutory rape is a strict liability offense, meaning that you don't have to know you're breaking the law or intend to break the law to be guilty of it. Having sex with someone under the age of consent is statutory rape (unless excluded by a caveat, like a Romeo clause). Assuming no Romeo clause, the 18 year old could definitely be charged with statutory rape. EDIT: This applies in the United States only, and no other country.

Napoleon was not there to play games, he was there to win...and he was very good at it until the others caught up.

If there is a river crossing, one side is attacking and one is defending. when the attackers move, the defenders have time to react...often hours.

It was kinda like an elaborate game of Chess. Napoleon came in as a poor kid and decided he didn't like these rich kids in the playground. So he started playing with them but when it came down to the point where the rich kids would surrender, Napoleon grabbed their toys and stomped them to pieces. Without toys to play the games the kids just went to the sidelines to complain and figure out how to get the playground back in order.\",\n",
       "    \"I think this is largely an illusion caused by literacy rates. In the Napoleonic era, most of the soldiers were illiterate. Thus the surviving accounts we have are almost entirely from officers, who wanted to seem noble and gentlemanly and presented that viewpoint in their written accounts. I suspect if we had surviving written accounts from the line soldiers, those accounts would not present warfare as so civil and organized. Right on the heels of the Napoleonic era we had the industrial revolution, and with greater emphasis on technical skills and greater economic surpluses to fund education, literacy skyrocketed. By the mid nineteenth century when the American Civil War and the Crimean War were fought, a large percentage of common soldiers were literate and many did leave surviving accounts in the form of letters and diaries. These accounts are full of the brutal details of terror, savagery, and ghastly wounds witnessed by the common soldiers, which doesn't seem gentlemanly at all. I don't think the 18th/early 19th century era was really more civil than later wars. Its just the surviving accounts we have come from a different class of people with a very different viewpoint than the common soldier.\",\n",
       "    'The images of large blocks of infantry maneuvering before battle as if they were on a parade ground, and units marching in close formation while under fire, might look strange and overly formal to a modern observer, but there were practical reasons for doing things this way, it wasn\\'t purely form or convention. As regards your first question, \"Wouldn\\'t it make more sense to attack with a major charge while your enemy\\'s troops were organizing?\" Armies didn\\'t just march up to each other, then organize, and then attack. Armies would get into battle order at considerable distance, with the main battle lines, supporting units, and reserves occupying the general positions they would be in for the attack. Once they were in battle order they would then move forward into potential attacking range. So from a defenders perspective, by the time the enemy is close enough for me to attack, then they would also probably be well prepared and positioned to defend that attack. Most of the time it would be better to hold my position, especially if terrain gives me some advantage that I would lose by moving forwards. As for infantry marching in rank and file while taking fire, there are a few things to note. First of all, infantry wouldn\\'t spend the entire battle doing this, it was generally only the relatively brief period of time when an attacking unit was attempting to close the distance with the enemy and then charge with bayonets, forcing the enemy unit to break or withdraw from their position. They did it in close order like this because, although they were vulnerable, it was really the only reliable way to get a large body of men to close that distance, charge the enemy, and then actually win that charge. For the charge to work effectively, physcially and psychologically, you need to have your people close together and acting as one unit rather than just as individuals. If they ran over the distance at full speed, then they would be winded and disorganized by the time they reach the enemy. If they moved forward as individuals, spaced out and taking cover, they\\'d probably move too slowly, would be too inclined to just sit in cover, and if they did get close enough to charge, the charge would be totally ineffective. Marching blocks of troops closing with the enemy would take heavy losses, but the slow reloading speed of muskets, and the cover provided by the clouds of smoke they caused, gave you a good chance of still having an effective force by the time you reached the enemy. If the attack fails, or looks like it will fail, then you can attack again with fresh units, or call off the attack. They wouldn\\'t stand at close range for extended periods just exchanging fire. At longer range, infantry would be relatively safe from musket fire. If they were taking casualties from longer ranged weapons like artillery, it was quite common for commanders to take measures to reduce those casualties, such as having their men sit or lie down, or move behind cover if possible.',\n",
       "    \"The Amrev was won by mostly unorganized contingents of Colony forces attacking supply routes and avoiding massive open field combat. As mentioned, the rifles in the 18th century were pretty much useless beyond 50-100 yards unless it was rifled (which was rare). However the volley strategy is more than likely what I think your talking about, where volley lines would essentially try to fire all of their rifles at once, fall behind another line that would then do the same, and return to the front once they were able to reload. Melee combat was still about 70-85% of the battle, and most of the battles were relatively quick. Despite this, the sounds and sites of battle were grotesque, and having an untrained, undisciplined unit is a fast way to get yourself killed. The introduction of the Gatling gun changed how officers had to plan for war going forward, large tight-packed groups lost their numbers advantage as soon as one man was able to dish out the lead that 100 still couldn't.\"]}},\n",

I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles.

I think that\\'s good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there\\'s still a link in the chain there that\\'s missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I\\'m sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn\\'t explaining anything that you don\\'t already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that\\'s just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I\\'m a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I\\'m keenly aware of them and they can\\'t be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can\\'t ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That\\'s generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren\\'t overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you\\'re just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don\\'t linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after.',\n",

Consider all the chemical reactions that take place in cooking; they result in differnt smells (and tastes). Smell can also tell you if fruit and vegiyables are ripe or even spoiled. Likewise of meat goes bad it give off a smell - kind of a warning. So you can think of that as being smiliar to being able to see or hear that information - since you get it from a distance. It it probably more similar to hearing since it doesn\\'t require direct or uninterrupted \"line - of - sight\". Off all my senses, smell is the one that most often conveys bad information. For like in the case of spoilage, the smell is revolting. Like a loud sound, or a bright light. Smell is a really strong trigger for memories too. For many people smelling cookies reminds them of home. Or maybe certain foods remind them of holidays. The part of the brain that processes olfactory (smell) information is closely associated with memories. Because smell gets stronger the closer you get to the subject, it often times draws me in for smells I like (good food, a woman with nice colonge, the smell of the woods, etc.), or drives me away for ones I dislike (spoilage, feeces, filth, body oder, too much fragrance, etc). As a parent of small children, smell is one way I know my kids needs a clean diaper. Often times he\\\\she will get cranky (audible) or show other visual signs. The smell is another queue. My mother in law has no sense of smell, so she would always stick a finger in the diaper to veifiy - which is messy. I just look when I am unsure. Generally speaking smell is a way we learn things not to eat. There are some poisons that are adapted to smell good or not at all, but very few things that smell bad that are good for you (individual tastes aside). So smell is just another way to collect information at a distance from the world around us. Most of that information can be collected other ways too. Especially if you took chemistry and have isolated different compounds and elemtents. Smell is just a convenient way to do that.. Edit: hit post early.',\n",
       "    \"A good smell is like feeling something very pleasant and soothing. It often elicits memories, as smell is very strongly tied to memory, and you may find yourself back in a happy childhood memory. The smell of bread in the oven would immediately transport your mind back to being a small child, helping your grandmother bake in the kitchen and feeling like the world was amazing and the day would last forever. It's a very visceral, all-over feeling when one is enveloped by a familiar, pleasant smell. You feel your body open up to pull it in, your eyes close and you salivate involuntarily, and everything around you slows just a little bit. Think of it a little like being in the afterglow of a good orgasm. Conversely, a bad smell is not as often tied with memory but creates a very physical response just the same. You'll feel your throat close as you gag, and your stomach churn or heave. The smell feels viscous and heavy in your mouth, as though it's tangible and you've bitten down on it. It seeps into you, burns a little, and feels thick and wet in your throat like you're choking on something slimy. Smelling something bad is like trying to swallow a mouthful of lukewarm eggwhites when you're already so full from eating that you're rather nauseated.\",\n",

It is to us, because we\\'re not adapted to it and our bodies really can\\'t take it. But, we and most other things are actually made out of liquids. Liquid doesn\\'t squish very much. Food is what decides how big things get. If you are thinking about size and think about fish, well, they only get so big. Whale sharks are pretty huge for a fish, but compared to warm blooded mammals, the great whales, they\\'re actually pretty average. Ironically, the largest boney fish - the Sun Fish - spends most of its time quite deep, hunting jellyfish. But it has to come up to the warmer waters near the surface to warm up from time to time. It\\'s hard being cold-blooded. It takes energy to do things and that\\'s why food is such an important factor. Many deeper ocean creatures that are active predators - that hunt for food, instead of just kind of gather it - don\\'t stay in the deep parts all the time. They \"go out for dinner\" coming to the shallows to hunt and then go back down later. Some of these are quite large, especially among jellyfish  & amp; their relatives and squids. It is believed the largest squids in the world live this way. And some of them wouldn\\'t fit in your living room, OP. Even at the bottom there are some big sharks that move about - six gill, seven gill and sleeper sharks can get big - longer and larger than a car. Then there\\'s the mammals that spend a bit of time in the deeper ocean, like sperm whales. They\\'re big. Then there\\'s the things that live down there all the time. The majority of these are small, limited in size mostly due the availability of food. However, on the abyssal plain - the sandy flat part of the ocean between the mountains that form islands and sea mounts and the crevices that form trenches - there are fields and fields of spiny skinned sea stars and sea urchins, walking along in their tube feet, hoovering up food that\\'s slowly sunk down to the bottom. They move in giant herds. There\\'s so many, and the area is so big - it\\'s the single largest habitat on Earth - that they might actually be the largest amount of animals on the planet, by weight. That\\'s despite what everyone says about bugs. Beetles. Everyone thinks they\\'re so cool. But then there\\'s the bottoms of the trenches. So far there\\'s no Pacific Rim sized Kayju down there that we\\'ve found, but when you stop thinking fish and start thinking other things there\\'s some real possibility. Hydrothermic vents are these cracks in the sea floor where really hot (like hotter than boiling) water comes shooting out, full of chemicals. There are creatures that can live next to these vents and live in the water who use the chemicals in the water for food. There\\'s a type of tube worm that lives there that can stand hotter than boiling water, that has no digestive tract - no tummy, no intestines and never goes poop - that is over 1 metre long. That may not sound all that big, but that\\'s pretty huge for a tube worm. They appear to be limited in size by the size of the vents they live on. Vents are little underwater volcanos. Get a big one and you get big tube worms. There are some rather large colonial jellyfish types down there that grow to be the size of a football field in length. That\\'s pretty big. Then there\\'s the less impressive - mostly because they don\\'t move around - but really huge bottom dwellers. Deep sea corals can be hundreds of meters long, just like their shallow water counterparts. As corals grow they leave their skeletons behind, which is what makes up reefs. There are massive deep-sea sponges that are thousands of years old. Then there are things like the methane-seep living cyanobacteria colonies. Those things are miles and miles across - bigger than anything on land. I don\\'t expect them to wade ashore to crush Tokyo anytime soon tho. They get massive because they live right next to a food source that\\'s been like an all you can eat buffet for thousands of years, and is still going strong. TLDR: Pressure isn\\'t that big of a deal. It\\'s all about food. EDIT: Removed an elephant to whale shark comparison as it was just plain wrong.',\n",

Other than that, I could imagine some kind of a fungal-like organism to basically cover the whole ocean floor. For creatures that would loosely resemble something from deep-sea horror movies, I'd imagine that mobility and food become an issue relatively soon; Surface area will grow proportionally more than body size, while body mass will grow by even more than surface area, as per the [square-cube law]( URL_1 ). You'll get slower while needing more and more food to eat.

(This is really fun to think about by the way) Many of these limits will be closely related to something called the square-cube law. As you begin to scale things up, the ratio of volume to surface area and volume to area of a cross section changes drastically even though the shape remains the same. If you take a 2x2x2 cube and compare its volume (8) surface area (24) and cross-section (4) to a 4x4x4 cube (64, 96, and 16) the effect is pretty clear. This is important because the volume is directly related to mass/weight, the cross section to how much force it takes to bend and break materials, and the surface area related to things like heat dissipation and the diffusion of things like oxygen through a membrane. As you get larger, your biomass increases much more quickly than your ability to support it! Bones can become so large that they crumble under their own weight, for example.',\n",

       "    \"Deep sea creatures are limited by these main resources: finding food, pressure, extreme cold, no light, and finding mates. As far as size goes, there are some pretty big deep sea creatures (think giant squid or colossal squid). The majority are much more reasonable sizes. Other animals that use the deep sea also will be quite larger (think sperm whales). For deep sea inhabitants: The extreme cold causes them to have a really slow metabolism, which in turn causes them to not need as much food for animals of a similar size. They move slow, eat less and their cellular processes are slower. So size is limited less by food and more by slow metabolism. They can get big, but it takes a long time (again, the giant squid is an exception, those are thought to have crazy short lifespans). More times than not, the energy to survive, find a mate and reproduce are so great in the deep that putting resources to size are not often a priority. For animals that use the deep sea: These guys tend to be big because of the cold. Sperm whales and the like have a lower surface area to retain their internal heat more easily. Theoretically, there could be some massive deep sea creatures if they are really old and generalist feeders.. but extremely unlikely. A metabolism for something that big couldn't easily be sustained.\",\n",
       "    \"Access to oxygen would be, by and far, the biggest factor. More so than pressure, more so than access to food. Available oxygen absolutely plummets as you go deeper and deeper into the ocean, and oxygen is vital for multi-cellular life to function well. Oxygen is necessary for metabolic processes. The bigger you are, the more oxygen you need just to drive your metabolism and subsist. It also means that your prey is going to be smaller, which greatly limits what you can eat. This is a limiting concern for *all* sea life though, and it's why really large gilled animals are comparatively rare. Most of the large sea creatures aren't gilled fish, but air breathing mammals like whales. The primary reason that whales can grow so big is because they can breathe oxygen from the far more oxygen-rich atmosphere, whereas even the fish that live close to the surface must rely on the significantly less oxygen rich water they are immersed in.\",\n",

For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (\"extravasate\"). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the \"high\" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting \"rush\" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to \"skin popping\", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial \"intradermal\" injection.

Turn your hand and cup it and now you can feel the force of the wind blowing by and probably hear the turbulence. Same air speed, radically different sound levels. Moving air isn't loud, but it has the potential to create a lot of noise, especially when you put something it its path to create turbulence. Something like the inlet and outlet grates on a hair dryer. Or a curly heating element. All of these can be designed to reduce sound levels, but that requires research and design. It requires more complex manufacturing processes and more expensive materials. In addition to the moving air, the stuff that makes the air move can also create noise. A cheap little motor will cause vibrations, some of which you can hear. These vibrations can be minimized through balancing and damping, but that requires research and design.

       "    'There are some constitutional law theories that may allow it, but they haven\\'t succeeded in practice. They stem from the fact that while the federal government has 3 branches, that\\'s only half of the picture. The individual states have rights as well (although they can really only challenge the federal government if they act together). The first is called [nullification]( URL_1 ). This is a legal theory that each state has the right to nullify any federal law that the state believes is unconstitutional. This isn\\'t explicitly laid out in the constitution, and has been rejected by both state and federal courts every time it\\'s been tried. A similar option is called [interposition]( URL_0 ). This involves multiple states acting together to prevent the ability of the federal government to enforce laws considered unconstitutional. This would buy the states time to go through the process of challenging laws. It would also wait out the clock until the next election which could correct the issues (the members of the House of Representatives have two year term limits). Then there\\'s an option that\\'s never been used and is rarely discussed in Article V of the Constitution. Article V discusses how amendments to the constitution are proposed, and so far they have all used the first option - a two-thirds vote by both the House of Representative and the Senate (then ratification by the states). But there\\'s a second option, often called an [Article V Convention]( URL_2 ) - If two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for a convention to propose amendments, the states could decide to directly change the Constitution *without any say from federal government*. The state governments would be able to restructure the government at will, as long as three-quarters of the states agreed on new amendments proposed. Changing the Constitution directly isn\\'t something to do lightly, of course. An Article V Convention is really just a last resort in case the three branches of government unite to do something extreme, like amending the constitution themselves to make the president a dictator for life. But it\\'s a good reminder that the federal government is only given power by the states, who are given power by the people of the states, which is noted in the very first line of the Constitution. The power comes from \"We, the people of the United States\" - nowhere else.',\n",

Checks and balances is a philosophy that states that each branch should have the power to regulate the actions of each other branch. It does *not* give power to the parties in any way. The entire purpose of the structure of the government was to prevent a single organization from supplanting the power of the others, meaning that governmental power could be as decentralized as possible. If a party wins control of the majority in the House, Senate, and Presidency (yes, I know that\\'s not the three branches of government, but it\\'s the real focus of this discussion, so bear with me), then it is entirely within their rights to push their agenda. The government was built precisely to allow for this type of change. The support of a wide variety of people in disparate states was necessary to pull off the current Republican domination of the government, and the Constitution was written specifically to allow the people to enforce the desired change by electing representatives that support their wishes. As much as it may upset you, there is nothing unconstitutional about the current situation in government. In fact, the Democrats were in much the same position in 2008. The constitution was written precisely so that this type of radical shift in policy could be implemented by the voters if they felt that the government acting in accordance with their wishes.',\n",

However, that would probably be more like an agenda being approved by or surviving checks and balances, rather than bypassing them entirely. If you mean something more extreme like enacting laws that blatantly go against the Constitution or cause changes that would alter a branch's power, that could also be done, but it would require an amendment to be passed. An amendment generally requires approval from 2/3 of each house in Congress plus 3/4 of the states. If passed, an amendment can't be rejected by anything other than another amendment and it could even alter the balances between branches. An amendment can be as partisan as possible, although it's unlikely that a partisan amendment could pass.

All of the dead blood cells, bacteria and other breakdown products are what form pus (and by weight it\\'s almost all white blood cells). Like most processes relating to infection, you can have too much of a good thing, and while the inflammatory response is necessary for healing, pus building up to the visible levels the OP is thinking of is a sign that infection is not under control. If pus collects into an abscess, it\\'s best to drain it away - even if you are on antibiotics, the pH changes considerably in the middle of an abscess, and antibiotics may not penetrate to the middle or work as well.

Trapped pus can form an abscess~~, and sometimes a cyst~~ when your body tries to wall off the infection. Also, wounds heal best in a moist environment. Too much pus and other liquids (called exudate) can lead to the breakdown of the surrounding healthy skin. Edit: thanks u/cclugston13 for correcting me about cysts... I know mostly about chronic wounds, not so much other health related things. For those curious about moist wound healing- google up Dr. George Winter. This approach is used for many chronic wounds and is very successful. Healthy individuals with small wounds generally don't need this type of wound environment to heal, but it would still help it heal faster, but healthy people heal so fast that it really is more trouble than it's worth.

White blood cells work by basically eating pathogens, but if the infection is very wide spread the will eat until they gorge themselves until they burst. When they burst they release partially digested pathogens back into the system that are less infectious that what they originally ate. That is basically what pus is. Now this is like on a cellular level and cells are tiny. If you can see like a little bit of pus, like a zit, you can imagine that this is millions of white blood cell remains. Generally speaking if the \"war\" is going this wide spread, the infection is pretty serious. You have to imagine white blood cells like policemen picking up little pathogens here and there all over your body all the time, so when you have a large concentrated area of large infection like a wound or something like a clogged pour, especially one clogged with a foreign object like a tiny rock or piece of dust, your body sends tons of white blood cells into fight the long fight. And that long fight definitely racks up a toll. Pus is the evidence of the wars toll and is generally an indication that the war is both very big and not exactly winning/ won yet, only on going with many large battles still on going. This is why generally if a wound has pus it is considered very serious because it\\'s an indication that your body is fighting as hard as it can to fight the infection and struggling. This is why you treat cuts and scrapes with antibiotics like alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, etc. to prevent things from ever getting to this stage. It\\'s also very hard on your body to have your immune system in like war mode for an extended period of time. Basically you are fighting the infection and pathogens on the outside of your body while your immune system fights it on the inside so the bad guys are fighting a war on two fronts. Your lymph nodes only have so much capacity to make white blood cells and it\\'s important to note that even if your body is fighting a big war with an infection in your body, it\\'s also still policing your body like normal too. If the fight is too long and hard somethings going to give, either your body won\\'t be able to fight the existing infection and start losing ground or more commonly small infections your body would have been able to fight easily will now be too difficult to stop from growing by your over taxed immune system.

       "    \"You procrastinate due to stress and discomfort. Stress causes you to tend to do things that will avoid the stress. Deep down you might be afraid of doing a terrible job on your paper, so the idea of working on the paper is stressful. Your expected result is negative, you imagine doing a disappointing job. Doing that paper will be hard, and it will result in a bad feeling. On the other hand, nearly anything is preferable. If you clean your room, you will succeed. It's very unlikely you will fail at cleaning your room. It will make you feel like you've accomplished something. If you start to clean your room, you immediately feel better because you are distracted. You finish cleaning your room and feel better. This might be a good thing for prompting you to do something uncomfortable. You're now in a more comfortable space, you've just accomplished something, you feel better. Unfortunately, in the case of a paper that is due, another result is you've now got less time to complete it, so you're even more certain the paper is going to be inadequate. That stress forces you to seek out something that will comfort you. Maybe you will have a snack, you're getting a bit hungry, you'll do a better job if you don't try to write the paper hungry. Oh shit, another 20 minutes have passed. etc. Eventually, the stress builds up to the point that it motivates you to act because you aren't worried about whether you're going to have a good enough paper, you're worried about whether you will have any paper at all, and by that point your only escape is to either write the paper, or not. It's hard to break that cycle, and the only real way to do that is learn to mute that anticipation of discomfort. But that is rooted pretty deep in our psyche, and is really kind of the same sort of thing that keeps us from touching a hot stove. Some people get over it by psyching themselves up, and with positive self-talk. Personally, I think what's best is to cool down, meditate or otherwise clear my head, decide rationally what I'm going to do, and try to do the absolute least amount possible adequately. If it's a paper, I don't think about whether it's going to be good or not, I don't think about failure or success. I just open Word. I look at the assignment. I could just stop there if I want, that's easy. No reason to procrastinate on that. Then I take one more step, I choose my topic. It doesn't have to be the best topic, it just has to be a topic. Maybe I choose a few. They don't have to be the best. Then I think about which of those is the easiest for me to turn into something interesting. Again, nothing here is high pressure, nothing here is hard, I can't succeed or fail at any of this, I've just done some easy things. I am not doing it as the first steps to complete the paper, I'm not doing it with the goal to write an A level paper. I'm just thinking about the question, for myself. Of these topics, which point would be easiest to describe? Then maybe I would jot down some structure. Here's a topic to discuss, here's a topic to discuss, here's a topic to discuss. I'd think about why they're interesting. I wouldn't think about why my teacher would think they're interesting, but I've picked what I thought was the most interesting topic. Maybe I have an opinion or idea on this point of discussion, maybe I'll look it up to see if my opinion is shared or if my idea is supported. Oh cool, I was right. Oh cool, I was mistaken. I take a few notes about this. After a while, I'm genuinely interested in the topic, even if it wasn't something I was totally interested in to start with, I've given myself enough lead in to the paper to actually care about whether my preconceptions match reality, or some of the more interesting points in the discussion. By that point, I'm writing the paper for my own benefit. I'll format it in the structure that my teacher expects, but only because it's easy enough to do and get that out of the way while I'm working on figuring out some things about a topic that is now reasonably interesting.

Too dangerous to do it by hand- I remember one attempt at doing so led to the deaths of the 7 attempted recoverers, and you can't do it by machine because the mountain is either too steep, to windy, or the air too thin for helicopters to fly. The engines would suffocate from lack of oxygen or be unable to get off the ground because the blades couldn't push enough air down. Or both. And finally, because money. You got any idea how expensive it is to climb Everest? It's pricey and hard enough as is without 200+ pounds of literal dead weight on your back.\",\n",
       "    'For those who are saying \"it is too dangerous\" or \"they can\\'t\", I am sorry but you are wrong. Bodies and over 13 tons of trash have been removed from the mountain since 2008. The problem is not something that cannot be solved. The real answer is cost. Over 200 people reach the peak on some years. If enough of a bounty was offered to qualified climbers, they could and would bring the trash and even bodies (if only in parts) down the mountain. But who would pay for it and how many people would you have to pay to even keep up with the littering of 200+ people? One potential answer is to require a deposit into an escrow account prior to climbing Everest. At base camp, your supplies are inventoried. If you don\\'t return, you forfeit the deposit. If you do return you get some or all of the deposit returned based on what you returned with.',\n",

Carrying them down also poses too much risk. This is a place where just climbing and descending it already are incredibly hard, let alone climbing and descending it carry dead weight. (literally) The government there would love to have the dead bodies off Mt. Everest. It is sacred ground to them. But it is simply not feasible to risk the lives of so many people.\",\n",

And having someone climb up and drag a body down is incredibly dangerous - most climbers are lucky able to get themselves down alive from that altitude. Carrying another person in that environment is very dangerous, and should only be done by experienced climbers trying to save a life. It's just not worth anyone risking their necks to bring the bodies down.\",\n",

So that's people needing training to take on Everest, infrastructure to somehow get tools and supplies up the mountain to maintain this workforce who may have to dig the bodies out of snow, and then transport them back down the mountain again. I mean it COULD be done - but it is prohibitively expensive, and I doubt anyone wants to be the one to foot that bill.\",\n",

Now, Chevy has all sorts of reasons to want you to only use Chevy certified mechanics and official Chevy spare parts because they can make money from that service and maintain quality control. On the other hand, you as a consumer wants to find the best deal for repairs that you can and since you own the car, should be able to do so. Chevy says that they only provide parts to their guys and if you want a repair you're just stuck with a Chevy mechanic, sucks to be you. The right to repair is basically saying that you as the consumer should have a choice in who fixes your property.\",\n",
       "    'Several States are trying to introduce a \"right to repair\" bill. Of all of these States, only one - Nebraska - has actually scheduled a hearing to discuss the possible new law. The law, if it goes through, will require manufacturers (including Apple) to provide spare parts and service manuals to third parties. Apple have said that they will send representatives to argue against this new law. They believe that members of the public and third parties are not qualified to repair Apple products, and if they attempt to do so, it could result in damage such as batteries exploding.',\n",
       "    \"Apple wants to charge for their AppleCare and make it illegal for third-party entities to sell and/or service their products. They've argued things like if a third-party replaces a broken screen they can cut their finger accidentally so only Apple should be legally allowed to replace the screens on their products. Basically, Apple is trying to make it so that they can be the only entity to service and/or repair their products to keep out competition. Thus far, they have been fairly successful at suing and shutting down their competition in this space and are continuing the fight.\",\n",
       "    'the reason this is controversial is because it essentially gives apple a complete monopoly regarding their products, which they want, but is ultimately bad for consumers. Apple has a long history of doing this monopolistic behavior. It was the same way with apple peripherals, such as i homes and such. but eventually third parties started making cheaper \"ihome\" alternatives and then the overly expensive apple products were being priced out of the market. enter the lightning cable. now all of the third party products are no longer compatible with any of your new apple products, and the only way to get products that are is to buy them from apple as they are the only ones with rights to that cable design. then with the market being non competitive you get charged $7mil for your i home and there\\'s nothing you can do about it other than go without. you\\'ll notice that a similar thing is happening with the new iphone\\'s lack of headphone port. essentially having apple be the only one who is able to preform repair services on their products makes it so the market is non competitive and they can essentially charge whatever they want for the services unrestricted. cracked screen? $799. with competition such as those little kiosks in the mall however the price is competitive. if the mall kiosk guy will do it for $50 then apple can\\'t feasibly charge much more than him or nobody will go for the service. TL;DR: apple wants a monopoly and the argument is that there should be a competitive market for apple device services',\n",

If any old company is allowed to repair your iPhone then Apple will have to compete with them, they will probably have to charge less and make less money.
